abstract = {The development of olivocochlear efferent axons and their contacts in the postnatal cochlea was studied after DiI applications to the olivocochlear bundle in the ipsilateral brainstem of rats from 0 to 10 days of age (P0-10). Light microscopic analyses showed that labeled axons reached the vicinity of inner hair cells by P0 and outer hair cells by P2. Electron microscopic analyses demonstrated that labeled immature efferent axons are present among supporting cells of the greater epithelial ridge as well as inner hair cells at P0. The first efferent contacts that contacted inner hair cells contained a few irregularly sized vesicles and, occasionally, mitochondria. Postsynaptic specializations within inner hair cells apposed to labeled efferent axons included subsynaptic cisterns, irregularly sized vesicles, and synaptic bodies. Similar features were present in unlabeled profiles, presumed to be afferents, indicating that immature efferent axons could not be reliably distinguished from afferents without positive labeling. Efferent axons synapsed with outer hair cells by P4 and had synapse-like contacts at the bases of Deiters' cells at P4 and P6. Contacts between afferents and efferents were observed frequently in the inner spiral bundle from P6. As they matured, efferent axon terminals contacting hair cells contained increasing numbers of synaptic vesicles and were typically apposed by well-defined postsynaptic cisterns, thus acquiring distinctive profiles.},

abstract = {Distortion-product-otoacoustic-emission (DPOAE) phase-versus-frequency functions and corresponding phase-gradient delays have received considerable attention because of their potential for providing information about mechanisms of emission generation, cochlear wave latencies, and characteristics of cochlear tuning. The three measurement paradigms in common use (fixed-f1, fixed-f2, and fixed-f2/f1) yield significantly different delays, suggesting that they depend on qualitatively different aspects of cochlear mechanics. In this paper, theory and experiment are combined to demonstrate that simple phenomenological arguments, which make no detailed mechanistic assumptions concerning the underlying cochlear mechanics, predict relationships among the delays that are in good quantitative agreement with experimental data obtained in guinea pigs. To understand deviations between the simple theory and experiment, a general equation is found that relates the three delays for any deterministic model of DPOAE generation. Both model-independent and exact, the general relation provides a powerful consistency check on the measurements and a useful tool for organizing and understanding the structure in DPOAE phase data (e.g., for interpreting the relative magnitudes and intensity-dependencies of the three delays). Analysis of the general relation demonstrates that the success of the simple, phenomenological approach can be understood as a consequence of the mechanisms of emission generation and the approximate local scaling symmetry of cochlear mechanics. The general relation is used to quantify deviations from scaling manifest in the measured phase-gradient delays; the results indicate that deviations from scaling are typically small and that both linear and nonlinear mechanisms contribute significantly to these deviations. Intensity-dependent mechanisms contributing to deviations from scaling include cochlear-reflection and wave-interference effects associated with the mixing of distortion- and reflection-source emissions (as in DPOAE fine structure). Finally, the ratio of the fixed-f1 and fixed-f2 phase-gradient delays is shown to follow from the choice of experimental paradigm and, in the scaling limit, contains no information about cochlear physiology whatsoever. These results cast considerable doubt on the theoretical basis of recent attempts to use relative DPOAE phase-gradient delays to estimate the bandwidths of peripheral auditory filters.},

abstract = {Natural environments typically contain sound sources other than the source of interest that may interfere with the ability of listeners to extract information about the primary source. Studies of speech intelligibility and localization by normal-hearing listeners in the presence of competing speech are reported on in this work. One, two or three competing sentences [IEEE Trans. Audio Electroacoust. 17(3), 225-246 (1969)] were presented from various locations in the horizontal plane in several spatial configurations relative to a target sentence. Target and competing sentences were spoken by the same male talker and at the same level. All experiments were conducted both in an actual sound field and in a virtual sound field. In the virtual sound field, both binaural and monaural conditions were tested. In the speech intelligibility experiment, there were significant improvements in performance when the target and competing sentences were spatially separated. Performance was similar in the actual sound-field and virtual sound-field binaural listening conditions for speech intelligibility. Although most of these improvements are evident monaurally when using the better ear, binaural listening was necessary for large improvements in some situations. In the localization experiment, target source identification was measured in a seven-alternative absolute identification paradigm with the same competing sentence configurations as for the speech study. Performance in the localization experiment was significantly better in the actual sound-field than in the virtual sound-field binaural listening conditions. Under binaural conditions, localization performance was very good, even in the presence of three competing sentences. Under monaural conditions, performance was much worse. For the localization experiment, there was no significant effect of the number or configuration of the competing sentences tested. For these experiments, the performance in the speech intelligibility experiment was not limited by localization ability.},

abstract = {Developmental dyslexia is generally believed to result from impaired linguistic processing rather than from deficits in low-level sensory function. Challenging this view, we studied the perception of non-verbal acoustic stimuli and low-level auditory evoked potentials in dyslexic adults. Compared with matched controls, dyslexics were selectively impaired in tasks (frequency discrimination and binaural unmasking) which rely on decoding neural discharges phase-locked to the fine structure of the stimulus. Furthermore, this ability to use phase-locking was related to reading ability. In addition, the evoked potential reflecting phase-locked discharges was significantly smaller in dyslexics. These results demonstrate a low-level auditory impairment in dyslexia traceable to the brainstem nuclei.},

abstract = {Efferent cholinergic neurons project from the brainstem to inhibit sensory hair cells of the vertebrate inner ear. This inhibitory synapse combines the activity of an unusual class of ionotropic cholinergic receptor with that of nearby calcium-dependent potassium channels to shunt and hyperpolarize the hair cell. Postsynaptic calcium signalling is constrained by a thin near-membrane cistern that is co-extensive with the efferent terminal contacts. The postsynaptic cistern may play an essential role in calcium homeostasis, serving as sink or source, depending on ongoing activity and the degree of buffer saturation. Release of calcium from postsynaptic stores leads to a process of retrograde facilitation via the synthesis of nitric oxide in the hair cell. Activity-dependent synaptic modification may contribute to changes in hair cell innervation that occur during development, and in the aged or damaged cochlea.},

abstract = {Performance-intensity functions for monosyllabic words were obtained as a function of signal-to-noise ratio for broadband and low-pass filtered noise. Subjects were 11 normal-hearing listeners and 13 hearing-impaired listeners with flat, moderate sensorineural hearing losses and good speech-discrimination ability (at least 86%) in quiet. In the broadband-noise condition, only small differences in speech perception were noted between the two groups. In low-pass noise, however, large differences in performance were observed. These findings were correlated with various aspects of psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) obtained from the same individuals. Results of a multivariate analysis suggest that performance in broadband noise is correlated with filter bandwidth (Q10), while performance in low-pass noise is correlated with changes on the low-frequency side of the PTC.},

We tested 6- to 12-year-old children with SLI (N =19), children with SRD (N =55), and age-matched controls (N =36) for their passive auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) to tones, rapid tones, vowels and consonant-vowels. Thirty-eight percent of the children with SLI or SRD had less typical passive auditory ERPs in the N1-P2 window to sounds in general, rather than to tones, rapid tones, vowels or consonant-vowels specifically. The ERPs of these children were significantly 'flatter' in the N1-P2 region than normal. All the children with flatter ERPs in the N1-P2 region had poor non-word reading. A subgroup of these poor non-word readers also had poor non-word repetition. These findings support the hypothesis that impaired auditory processing is a causal risk factor for both SLI and SRD.},

abstract = {A well established method for estimating the shape of the auditory filter is based on the measurement of the threshold of a sinusoidal signal in a notched-noise masker, as a function of notch width. To measure the asymmetry of the filter, the notch has to be placed both symmetrically and asymmetrically about the signal frequency. In previous work several simplifying assumptions and approximations were made in deriving auditory filter shapes from the data. In this paper we describe modifications to the fitting procedure which allow more accurate derivations. These include: 1) taking into account changes in filter bandwidth with centre frequency when allowing for the effects of off-frequency listening; 2) correcting for the non-flat frequency response of the earphone; 3) correcting for the transmission characteristics of the outer and middle ear; 4) limiting the amount by which the centre frequency of the filter can shift in order to maximise the signal-to-masker ratio. In many cases, these modifications result in only small changes to the derived filter shape. However, at very high and very low centre frequencies and for hearing-impaired subjects the differences can be substantial. It is also shown that filter shapes derived from data where the notch is always placed symmetrically about the signal frequency can be seriously in error when the underlying filter is markedly asymmetric. New formulae are suggested describing the variation of the auditory filter with frequency and level. The implication of the results for the calculation of excitation patterns are discussed and a modified procedure is proposed. The appendix list FORTRAN computer programs for deriving auditory filter shapes from notched-noise data and for calculating excitation patterns. The first program can readily be modified so as to derive auditory filter shapes from data obtained with other types of maskers, such as rippled noise.},

abstract = {Synchronous presentation of stimuli to the auditory and visual systems can modify the formation of a percept in either modality. For example, perception of auditory speech is improved when the speaker's facial articulatory movements are visible. Neural convergence onto multisensory sites exhibiting supra-additivity has been proposed as the principal mechanism for integration. Recent findings, however, have suggested that putative sensory-specific cortices are responsive to inputs presented through a different modality. Consequently, when and where audiovisual representations emerge remain unsettled. In combined psychophysical and electroencephalography experiments we show that visual speech speeds up the cortical processing of auditory signals early (within 100 ms of signal onset). The auditory-visual interaction is reflected as an articulator-specific temporal facilitation (as well as a nonspecific amplitude reduction). The latency facilitation systematically depends on the degree to which the visual signal predicts possible auditory targets. The observed auditory-visual data support the view that there exist abstract internal representations that constrain the analysis of subsequent speech inputs. This is evidence for the existence of an "analysis-by-synthesis" mechanism in auditory-visual speech perception.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Olivocochlear (OC) neurons make up an efferent, descending auditory system that returns sound representations to the inner ear soon after they have entered the brain. Efferent inputs into the cochlea modulate outer hair cell activity to improve the neural encoding of auditory signals in background noise. Based on this physiological evidence, loss of efferent feedback is expected to degrade perception in noise. Attempts to confirm this prediction with long-term audiological assessments have met with mixed results.

OBJECTIVE:To isolate procedural factors that may diminish the demonstration of long-term OC deficits in listening tasks.

DESIGN:Operant conditioning procedures were used to train domestic cats to signal a change in the location of an auditory stimulus by responding on a lever. The smallest detectable change in location was measured by manipulating the distance between speakers under quiet conditions and in the presence of background noise. Functional consequences of efferent feedback were evaluated by comparing the sound localization thresholds of OC-lesioned cats with normal controls.

RESULTS:As predicted by the hypothesized function of OC feedback systems, the lesioned cats exhibited significantly elevated thresholds only when tested in background noise. This initially poor performance returned to normal values after long-term exposure to the testing procedure.

CONCLUSIONS:The results of our animal studies support the OC enhancement of sound localization behavior in background noise. Also, our behavioral observations suggest the acquisition of alternate listening strategies that allowed lesioned cats to minimize the functional consequences of their auditory deficits by attending more closely to remaining directional cues. These learned compensatory behaviors were encouraged by our present experimental design, which incorporated long-term training under consistent stimulus conditions. These findings point out the potential limitations of the highly routine audiological procedures that have been used to assess the impact of OC feedback on human hearing.},

abstract = {The microstructure of threshold hearing curves and the frequency spectra of evoked otoacoustic emissions both often evince a roughly periodic series of maxima and minima. Current models for the generation of otoacoustic emissions explain the observed spectral regularity by supposing that since the cochlea maps frequency into position the spectral periodicity mirrors a spatial oscillation in the mechanics of the organ of Corti. In this view emissions are generated when forward-traveling waves reflect from periodic corrugations in the mechanics, suggesting that the amplitude of the cochlear waves at the stapes--should manifest pronounced maxima and minima with a corresponding periodicity. This paper describes measurements of stimulus-frequency emissions, establishes their analyticity properties, and uses them to explore the spatial distribution of mechanical inhomogeneities (emission "generators") in the human cochlea. The approximate form and frequency dependence of the cochlear traveling-wave ratio are determined noninvasively. The amplitude of the empirical traveling-wave ratio is a slowly varying, nonperiodic function of frequency, suggesting that the distribution of inhomogeneities is uncorrelated with the periodicity found in the threshold microstructure. The observed periodicities arise predominantly from the cyclic variation in relative phase between the forward- and backward-traveling waves at the stapes.},

Subjects exhibited conventional sigmoid performance-intensity functions in continuous noise, for both unfiltered and filtered conditions. In contrast, subjects demonstrated shallower performance-intensity functions in the interrupted noise conditions with overall superior performance under adverse signal-to-noise ratios relative to the continuous noise conditions. Separate two-way analyses of variances investigating mean word recognition performance differences as a function of normal listening (unfiltered) versus the simulated hearing loss (filtered). Signal-to-noise ratio for both continuous and interrupted noise conditions revealed a significant main effects for S:N with both noise conditions (p < .05) and a significant main effect for the simulated hearing loss only in the interrupted noise condition (p < .05). It was hypothesized that subjects' diminished performance in the interrupted noise condition with the stimulated high frequency hearing loss reflected a reduced ability to temporally resolve auditory information between the gaps of noise.},

The present experiments tested a free-field analog of their experiment. The stimuli consisted of narrow bands of noise, pairs of which represented the first and second formants of the whispered vowels "ar," "ee," "er," and "oo." A target noise-band pair (vowel) was presented at various angles on the listeners' left while a complementary distracter was presented on the listeners' right. Listeners correctly identified the target vowel in the free-field well above chance. Performance remained well above chance in headphone experiments that retained spatial cues but eliminated reverberations and head movements. The full range of cues that normally determine perceived spatial location provided sufficient information for segregation. Further experiments, which systematically evaluated the contribution of these cues in isolation and in combination, showed that some listeners, following training, exhibited the ability to segregate based on ongoing ITDs alone. Substantial individual differences were observed. The results show that listeners can use spatial cues to segregate simultaneous sound sources.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:High temporal acuity of auditory processing underlies perception of speech and other rapidly varying sounds. A common measure of auditory temporal acuity in humans is the threshold for detection of brief gaps in noise. Gap-detection deficits, observed in developmental disorders, are considered evidence for "sluggish" auditory processing. Here we show, in a mouse model of gap-detection deficits, that auditory brain sensitivity to brief gaps in noise can be impaired even without a general loss of central auditory temporal acuity. Extracellular recordings in three different subdivisions of the auditory thalamus in anesthetized mice revealed a stimulus-specific, subdivision-specific deficit in thalamic sensitivity to brief gaps in noise in experimental animals relative to controls. Neural responses to brief gaps in noise were reduced, but responses to other rapidly changing stimuli unaffected, in lemniscal and nonlemniscal (but not polysensory) subdivisions of the medial geniculate body. Through experiments and modeling, we demonstrate that the observed deficits in thalamic sensitivity to brief gaps in noise arise from reduced neural population activity following noise offsets, but not onsets. These results reveal dissociable sound-onset-sensitive and sound-offset-sensitive channels underlying auditory temporal processing, and suggest that gap-detection deficits can arise from specific impairment of the sound-offset-sensitive channel.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:The experimental and modeling results reported here suggest a new hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of temporal processing in the auditory system. Using a mouse model of auditory temporal processing deficits, we demonstrate the existence of specific abnormalities in auditory thalamic activity following sound offsets, but not sound onsets. These results reveal dissociable sound-onset-sensitive and sound-offset-sensitive mechanisms underlying auditory processing of temporally varying sounds. Furthermore, the findings suggest that auditory temporal processing deficits, such as impairments in gap-in-noise detection, could arise from reduced brain sensitivity to sound offsets alone.},

Methods of measuring the temporal resolution of the auditory system are also reviewed, and results are compared for normally hearing and hearing-impaired subjects. Temporal resolution is impaired in most but not all cases of sensorineural hearing loss. It is concluded that the loss of frequency and temporal resolution accompanying cochlear hearing loss is a major cause of the difficulties encountered by the hearing impaired in understanding speech in noisy situations.},

abstract = {Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory steady state evoked response potentials (ASSRs) can both be evoked by tone pairs with frequencies f(1) and f(2). The DPOAE is maximal at 2f(1)-f(2) and the ASSR is maximal at f(2)-f(1). Since DPOAE magnitude depends on the ratio f(2)/f(1), but ASSR amplitude depends on the beat frequency f(2)-f(1), compromises are necessary when recording both responses concurrently. Tone pairs with f(2) of 900, 1800 and 3600 Hz were presented simultaneously at either 40 or 50 dB sound pressure level (SPL). The f(1) frequency of each pair was approximately 85 or 180 Hz lower than f(2). Phase measurements were used to calculate apparent latencies at 40 dB SPL. For increasing f(2), DPOAE latencies were 14.5, 9.7 and 6.3 ms for 85 Hz beats, and 11.5, 9.0 and 4.3 ms for 180 Hz beats. ASSR latencies were 22.0, 15.7 and 17.8 ms at 85 Hz, and 17.7, 11.3 and 9.6 ms at 180 Hz. From a model of the mechanical transmission in the cochlea, delays between the basilar membrane and the generator of the ASSR were estimated as 15.4, 12.2 and 15.3 ms at 85 Hz and 8.6, 7.6 and 8.0 ms at 180 Hz.},

abstract = {Immunostaining of the cat superior olivary complex with antisera against glycine, calbindin, GABA, and its synthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) reveals considerable new information about neural connections that underlie processing of binaural signals. Antisera against glycine and calbindin immunostain principal cells and processes of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). The extent of staining of fine processes afforded by the calbindin antisera reveals collateral processes of MNTB axons within the medial superior olive (MSO) and numerous terminals of these collaterals on neuronal somata and proximal dendrites. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of these terminals shows them to have the morphological features characteristic of inhibitory synapses, indicating that there can be considerable inhibitory inputs to MSO cells from the contralateral cochlear nucleus via the MNTB. Immunostaining for GAD and GABA shows some GABAergic inputs, mostly to dendrites within the MSO. Within the MNTB there are elaborate GABAergic endings that surround the principal cells. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of these terminals reveals the expected features characteristic of inhibitory synapses. The glycinergic inhibitory output of the MNTB cells is therefore subject to disinhibition by activity of these elaborate GABAergic inputs. Other endings that immunostain with antisera to leucine- enkephalin and neurotensin are found in modest amounts in both MSO and MNTB. Immunostaining of neuronal somata within the superior olivary complex suggests that the origins of the peptidergic and GABAergic endings in the MSO and MNTB may be periolivary cells. Whatever the origins, the results clearly indicate that control of the inhibitory GABAergic inputs to the MNTB can profoundly affect the inhibitory glycinergic MNTB outputs to other principal olivary nuclei. Investigations of the circumstances under which these circuits are activated will reveal much about neural processing that underlies binaural hearing.},

abstract = {1. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a pervasive property of acoustic communication systems. In the present study we investigate neural temporal mechanisms in the auditory nerve and cochlear nuclei of the pentobarbital sodium-anesthesized cat associated with the neural coding of 100% AM tones, both in quiet and in the presence of wideband, quasi-flat-spectrum noise. The AM carrier frequency was set to the neuron's characteristic frequency (CF) and the sound pressure level (SPL) of acoustic stimuli was varied over a wide dynamic range of intensities (< or = 40 dB). The temporal AM-encoding capability of auditory neurons was measured by computing the synchronization coefficient (SC) of the neural response to the signal's modulation and carrier frequency. The temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF) of a neuron was then computed by measuring the SC of the response to signals of variable fmod (50-2550 Hz). 2. Neurons in the cochlear nuclei synchronize on average more highly to the modulation frequency than fibers of comparable CF, threshold, and spontaneous rate in the auditory nerve. The disparity in performance is greatest at high SPLs and low signal-to-noise ratios. However, there is a significant degree of diversity in AM-encoding capability among neurons in both the cochlear nuclei and auditory nerve. Among auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), low- and medium-spontaneous-rate (SR) units (SR < 18 spike/s) phase-lock with greater precision than comparable high-SR units at any given frequency, particularly at moderate to high SPLs, consistent with previous studies. 3. The phase-locking capabilities of neurons in the cochlear nucleus are considerably more variable than in the auditory nerve. Moreover, the variability itself depends on two distinct measures of phase-locking performance. Most ANFs are capable of phase-locking to frequencies as high as 3-4 kHz. In the cochlear nucleus many unit types do not phase-lock to modulation frequencies > 1 kHz. As a result, phase-locking performance is measured on the basis of two parameters, maximum synchronization, irrespective of stimulus frequency, and the upper frequency limit for significant phase-locking. 4. Cochlear nucleus neurons may be divided into three distinct groups on the basis of maximum synchronization capability. In group 1 are the primary-like (PL) units of the anteroventral division, whose phase-locking capabilities are comparable with those of high-SR ANFs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {In everyday complex listening situations, sound emanating from several different sources arrives at the ears of a listener both directly from the sources and as reflections from arbitrary directions. For localization of the active sources, the auditory system needs to determine the direction of each source, while ignoring the reflections and superposition effects of concurrently arriving sound. A modeling mechanism with these desired properties is proposed. Interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) cues are only considered at time instants when only the direct sound of a single source has non-negligible energy in the critical band and, thus, when the evoked ITD and ILD represent the direction of that source. It is shown how to identify such time instants as a function of the interaural coherence (IC). The source directions suggested by the selected ITD and ILD cues are shown to imply the results of a number of published psychophysical studies related to source localization in the presence of distracters, as well as in precedence effect conditions.},

With functional magnetic resonance imaging it was found that these linguistic visual cues are sufficient to activate auditory cortex in normal hearing individuals in the absence of auditory speech sounds. Two further experiments suggest that these auditory cortical areas are not engaged when an individual is viewing nonlinguistic facial movements but appear to be activated by silent meaningless speechlike movements (pseudospeech). This supports psycholinguistic evidence that seen speech influences the perception of heard speech at a prelexical stage.},

abstract = {The field of Audiology in India has expanded exponentially in recent years. Audiologists practice in a variety of work places. However, little is known about the practice trends across these several work places. An Internet-based survey probing into Audiology practice was conducted between June and September 2012. The survey focused on four domains, namely, demography, assessment, hearing aid (HA) fitting and protocol usage. A total of 199 audiologists completed the survey. A large proportion of these audiologists were from Southern India. Majority of the respondents provide hearing assessment and HA services for children and adults. Results indicate diverse practice among respondents, even in essential procedures such as otoscopy. Although a large proportion of audiologists reported performing HA fitting in children as well as adults, less than 12~% of them performed real ear or simulated real ear verification during any HA fitting.

abstract = {This study measured the accuracy with which human listeners can localize spoken words. A broadband (300 Hz-16 kHz) corpus of monosyllabic words was created and presented tolisteners using a virtual auditory environment. Localization was examined for 76 locations ona sphere surrounding the listener. Experiment 1 showed that low-pass filtering the speech sounds at 8 kHz degraded performance, causing an increase in polar angle errors associated with the cone of confusion. In experiment 2 it was found that performance in fact varied systematically with the level of the signal above 8 kHz. Although the lower frequencies (below 8 kHz) are known to be sufficient for accurate speech recognition in most situations, these results demonstrate that natural speech contains information between 8 and 16 kHz that is essential for accurate localization.},

abstract = {The development of inhibitory synaptic transmission is difficult to assess because the afferents usually arise from intrinsic neurons that are difficult to stimulate independently. The postnatal maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function was compared in the gerbil lateral superior olive (LSO), where it is possible to stimulate physically discrete afferent projections. Intracellular recordings obtained in a brain slice preparation revealed that transmission was prominent at birth. The EPSPs and IPSPs were up to 2 orders of magnitude longer than in more mature animals. Brief trains of electrical stimulus pulses led to a temporal summation of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in 1-14 d animals resulting in prolonged depolarizations or hyperpolarizations. In neonates, the depolarization could exceed 1 sec following a 70 msec stimulus train. The IPSPs in neonates were often of sufficient amplitude to evoke a rebound depolarization or action potential. The number of converging afferents was estimated from the quantized increases in PSP size. There was a significant decrease with age, suggesting that both inhibitory and excitatory afferents were eliminated during the first 3 postnatal weeks. The integration of action potentials with IPSPs was examined with conjoint stimuli to the two afferent pathways, and demonstrated that the effective IPSP duration decreased approximately 20-fold during the first 3 postnatal weeks. The magnitudes and durations of electrical stimulus-evoked PSPs suggest that spontaneous discharge of afferents to the LSO could have a substantial impact on their development, even prior to the response to airborne sound at 12 d. Furthermore, the synaptic responses obtained at 12-14 d postnatal indicated that both amplitude and temporal processing remain compromised. These immature synaptic properties would be expected to compound the inadequacies present in the cochlea and cochlear nucleus.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:1) To describe the auditory brain stem response (ABR) measurement system and optimized methods used for study of newborn hearing screening. 2) To determine how recording and infant factors related to the screening, using well-defined, specific ABR outcome measures.

DESIGN:Seven thousand one hundred seventy-nine infants, 4478 from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the remaining from the well-baby nursery, were evaluated with an automated ABR protocol in each ear. Two channel recordings were obtained (vertex to mastoid or channel A and vertex to nape of neck or channel B) in response to click stimuli of 30 and 69 dB nHL in all infants as well as 50 dB nHL in infants who did not meet criteria for response at 30 dB. Criteria for response included F(SP) > or =3.1 and a tester-judgment of response. Criteria could be met in the first or repeat test with a maximum of 6144 accepted sweeps per test.

RESULTS:More than 99% of infants could complete the ABR protocol. More than 90% of NICU and well-baby nursery infants "passed" given the strict criteria for response, whereas 86% of those with high risk factors met criterion for ABR response detection. The number of infants who did not meet ABR response criteria in one or both ears was systematically related to stimulus level with the largest group not meeting criteria at 30 dB followed by 50 and 69 dB nHL. Meeting criteria on the ABR was positively correlated with the amplitude of wave V, with low noise and low electrode impedance. Factors that predicted how many sweeps would be needed to reach criterion F(SP) included noise level of the test site, state of the baby (for example, quiet sleep versus crying), recording noise, electrode impedance and response latency. Channel A (vertex to mastoid) reached criterion more often than channel B (vertex to nape of neck) due to higher noise in channel B. Average total test time for 30 dB nHL screening in both ears was under 8 minutes. Well babies with risk factors took slightly longer to evaluate than other groups with this automated ABR procedure and have higher noise levels.

CONCLUSIONS:ABR implemented with an automated detection algorithm using a 30 dB nHL click stimulus is reliable technique for rapid assessment of auditory status in newborns. Factors other than hearing loss that influenced the test result include infant state, electrode location and impedance, testing site, and infant risk status. Even so, ABRs were reliably recorded in the vast majority of babies under circumstances in which most babies are found in the perinatal period.},

Here, we show that neonatal inner hair cells are inhibited by cholinergic synaptic input before the onset of hearing.

abstract = {Binaural interaction (BI) in brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) were examined in normal term neonates. The BI components coincided consistently with the latency range of BAER wave IV through wave VII. Most BI components seen in the adults could be identified in the neonates, but the later components, i.e. those with longer latency, were underdeveloped in wave form. Wave DV was the most consistent and reproducible BI component. A marked difference between the neonatal and adult BI wave forms was that wave DVII was particularly small in the neonates. It appears that neuronal responses contributing to later BI components such as wave DVII are particularly immature at birth. Wave latencies and interpeak intervals were longer and amplitudes were smaller in the neonates than in the adults, which was associated with the differences between the neonates and adults in the BAER components. Changes in the BI components with stimulus intensity and rate in the neonates were fundamentally similar to but more significant compared with those in the adults. These findings suggest that neural connections in human auditory brainstem subserving the BI are established at birth but, particularly at higher levels of the brainstem, are immature.},

Analysis of the time-frequency properties of transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) is therefore of considerable interest due to their close relation with cochlear mechanisms. In particular, since OAEs in response to click stimuli are expected to evoke a cumulative response from the whole cochlea, the analysis of click-evoked OAEs can yield a global view of cochlear function. Wavelet analysis is performed to obtain time-frequency distributions of click-evoked OAEs at various intensity levels from normal ears. By means of the inverse wavelet transform, the recorded responses are decomposed into elementary components representing the contribution within a narrow frequency band to the cumulative OAE. The relationship between the frequency of the elementary components, latency and level of stimulation is described.},

abstract = {Fine structure in the frequency response of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) can severely limit the usefulness of DPOAEs in estimating auditory thresholds. Here, fine structure is removed by extracting the primary-source DPOAE component using the onset-decomposition technique (Vete{\v s}n{\'\i}k et~al., 2009) and auditory threshold estimates are compared to those obtained from DPOAEs in response to conventional, continuous two-tone stimulation. Auditory thresholds are predicted using the estimated distortion product thresholds (EDPTs), obtained from linear regression of input-output (I/O) functions of DPOAE pressure amplitude versus second-tone stimulus level (Boege and Janssen, 2002). The accuracy of the auditory-threshold predictions is derived by comparison with measured auditory thresholds. The parameters of the two primary stimulus tones of frequency f(1) and f(2) and levels of L(1) and L(2) are chosen as: f(2)/f(1)~=~1.2 with 1.5~$\le$~f(2)~$\le$~2.5~kHz, and L(1)~=~0.4L(2)~+~39~dB SPL, with 25~$\le$~L(2)~$\le$~65~dB SPL. Data are from 12 normal-hearing subjects with profound DPOAE fine structure. 255 DPOAE I/O functions were measured for each of the two DPOAE paradigms. An EDPT value was accepted as reliable if: 1) the squared correlation coefficient, r(2)~$\ge$~0.8, 2) the regression slope, s(I/O)~$\ge$~0.2~$\mu$Pa/dB, and 3) the standard deviation of the EDPT, $\sigma$(EDPT)~$\le$~10~dB. The proportion of rejected I/O functions was 8% for onset-decomposition DPOAEs, and 25% for continuous-tone DPOAEs. Removal of data points from the saturation region of the DPOAE I/O function by an automated algorithm reduced the rejection rate, to zero for onset-decomposition DPOAEs, but to only 13% for continuous-tone DPOAEs. In the absence of saturated DPOAE responses, auditory thresholds were predicted with standard deviation of only 4~dB for onset-decomposition DPOAEs, but 12~dB for continuous-tone DPOAEs. In summary, by extracting the primary-source component of the DPOAE by the method of onset-decomposition it is possible to predict human auditory threshold with hitherto unattainable accuracy.},

abstract = {The rationale to evaluate for central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in school-aged children is based on the assumption that an auditory-specific perceptual deficit underlies many learning problems including specific reading and language disabilities. A fundamental issue in this area is whether convincing empirical evidence exists to validate this proposition. Herein, we consider the issue of modality specificity by examining the extent to which reading, language, and attention disorders in school-aged children involve perceptual dysfunctions limited to a single sensory modality. Difficulty in validating CAPD as a diagnostic label is due in large part to use of the unimodal inclusive framework, which has biased the diagnosis to favor sensitivity of test results over documenting the specificity of the deficit. Indeed, empirical research documenting modality-specific auditory-perceptual dysfunction in this population is scarce. Therefore, the existing literature on this topic has not clarified the "true" nature of the problem, and has left many questions about this disorder unanswered. It is argued that demonstrating modality specificity is one way to rule out supramodal disorders as explanations for observed dysfunction. Multimodal perceptual testing is one logical approach to help clarify this area of investigation.},

abstract = {Over the last four decades, a range of different neuroimaging tools have been used to study human auditory attention, spanning from classic event-related potential studies using electroencephalography to modern multimodal imaging approaches (e.g., combining anatomical information based on magnetic resonance imaging with magneto- and electroencephalography). This review begins by exploring the different strengths and limitations inherent to different neuroimaging methods, and then outlines some common behavioral paradigms that have been adopted to study auditory attention. We argue that in order to design a neuroimaging experiment that produces interpretable, unambiguous results, the experimenter must not only have a deep appreciation of the imaging technique employed, but also a sophisticated understanding of perception and behavior. Only with the proper caveats in mind can one begin to infer how the cortex supports a human in solving the "cocktail party" problem.

abstract = {Communication signals are likely to be one of the primary forms of acoustic stimulation within three-dimensional auditory displays, yet the ability to localize these signals has received relatively little study. We investigated the ability to localize single-word speech targets, spoken by one male and one female talker, as compared to the ability to localize click targets. On each trial, the targets could arise from any one of 239 speaker locations that surrounded the subject in azimuth and ranged from -45 degrees to +90 degrees in elevation. The results showed that localization accuracy relative to the median plane (the Left/Right dimension) was good for both the speech and nonspeech targets. However, with speech targets, there were more front/back reversals (inaccurate judgments relative to the frontal plane, the Front/Back dimension) and typically less accurate elevation judgments (inaccurate judgments relative to the horizontal plane, the Up/Down dimension) than were found with click targets. These results have important implications for applications of spatial hearing technology and suggest that need for caution when designing three-dimensional auditory displays in order to assure that spatial information is conveyed appropriately.},

abstract = {The effect of smearing the temporal envelope on the speech-reception threshold (SRT) for sentences in noise and on phoneme identification was investigated for normal-hearing listeners. For this purpose, the speech signal was split up into a series of frequency bands (width of 1/4, 1/2, or 1 oct) and the amplitude envelope for each band was low-pass filtered at cutoff frequencies of 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 Hz. Results for 36 subjects show (1) a severe reduction in sentence intelligibility for narrow processing bands at low cutoff frequencies (0-2 Hz); and (2) a marginal contribution of modulation frequencies above 16 Hz to the intelligibility of sentences (provided that lower modulation frequencies are completely present). For cutoff frequencies above 4 Hz, the SRT appears to be independent of the frequency bandwidth upon which envelope filtering takes place. Vowel and consonant identification with nonsense syllables were studied for cutoff frequencies of 0, 2, 4, 8, or 16 Hz in 1/4-oct bands. Results for 24 subjects indicate that consonants are more affected than vowels. Errors in vowel identification mainly consist of reduced recognition of diphthongs and of confusions between long and short vowels. In case of consonant recognition, stops appear to suffer most, with confusion patterns depending on the position in the syllable (initial, medial, or final).},

A GOM function was measured using a 40-ms, 2.8-kHz tone (the off-frequency masker). GOM functions were then measured with an on-frequency, fixed level precursor presented before the off-frequency masker. The precursor was 50 or 60 dB SPL, and 160 ms in duration. For the 60-dB SPL precursor, a 40-ms duration was also used. Two-line functions were fit to the GOM data to estimate the basilar membrane input-output function. The precursors reduced the gain of the input-output function, and this decrease was graded with precursor level. Both precursor durations had the same effect on gain. Changes in masking following a precursor were larger than would be predicted by additivity of masking. The observed decrease in gain may be consistent with activation of the medial olivocochlear reflex by the precursor.},

abstract = {Cochlear implants are currently the standard treatment for profound sensorineural hearing loss. In the last decade, advances in auditory science and technology have not only greatly expanded the utility of electric stimulation to other parts of the auditory nervous system in addition to the cochlea, but have also demonstrated drastic changes in the brain in responses to electric stimulation, including changes in language development and music perception. Volume 20 of SHAR focused on basic science and technology underlying the cochlear implant. However, due to the newness of the ideas and technology, the volume did not cover any emerging applications such as bilateral cochlear implants, combined acoustic-electric stimulation, and other types of auditory prostheses, nor did it review brain plasticity in responses to electric stimulation and its perceptual and language consequences. This proposed volume takes off from Volume 20, and expands the examination of implants into new and highly exciting areas. This edited book starts with an overview and introduction by Dr. Fan-Gang Zeng. Chapters 2-9 cover technological development and the advances in treating the full spectrum of ear disorders in the last ten years. Chapters 10-15 discuss brain responses to electric stimulation and their perceptual impact. This volume is particularly exciting because there have been quantum leap from the traditional technology discussed in Volume 20. Thus, this volume is timely and will be of real importance to the SHAR audience.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:To quantify how 9 different diagnostic criteria affected potential (central) auditory processing disorder ([C]APD) diagnoses in a large sample of children referred for (central) auditory processing ([C]AP) assessment.

METHOD:A file review was conducted on 150 children (94 boys and 56 girls; ages 7.0-15.6 years) with normal peripheral hearing who had completed a (C)AP assessment involving low-pass filtered speech, competing sentences, 2-pair dichotic digits, and frequency patterns with linguistic and nonlinguistic report. Each child was classified as having or not having (C)APD based on 9 different sets of diagnostic criteria drawn from published technical reports, position statements, and selected research.

RESULTS:The rates of potential (C)APD diagnosis ranged from 7.3% for the strictest criteria to 96.0% for the most lenient criteria.

abstract = {Medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent fibers synapse directly on the outer hair cells (OHCs). Efferent activation evoked by contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS) will affect OHC amplification and subsequent measures of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The aim of this study was to investigate measures of total and separated DPOAEs during efferent activation. Efferent activation produces both suppression and enhancement of the total DPOAE level. Level enhancements occurred near fine-structure minima and were associated with consistent MOC evoked upward shifts in DPOAE fine-structure frequency. Examination of the phase of the separated components revealed that frequency shifts stemmed from increasing phase leads of the reflection component during CAS, while the generator component phase was nearly invariant. Separation of the two DPOAE components responsible for the fine-structure revealed more consistent reduction of the levels of both components. Using vector subtraction (which takes into account both level and phase) to estimate the changes in the unseparated DPOAE provided consistent evidence of DPOAE suppression. Including phase information provided a more sensitive, valid and consistent estimate of CAS function even if one does not know the position of the DPOAE in the fine-structure.},

abstract = {The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system is an important component of an active mechanical outer hair cell system in mammals. An extensive neurophysiological literature demonstrates that the MOC system attenuates the response of the cochlea to sound by reducing the gain of the outer hair cell mechanical response to stimulation. Despite a growing understanding of MOC physiology, the biological role of the MOC system in mammalian audition remains uncertain. Some evidence suggests that the MOC system functions in a protective role by acting to reduce receptor damage during intense acoustic exposure. For the MOC system to have evolved as a protective mechanism, however, the inner ears of mammals must be exposed to potentially damaging sources of noise that can elicit MOC-mediated protective effects under natural conditions. In this review, we evaluate the possibility that the MOC system evolved to protect the inner ear from naturally occurring environmental noise. Our survey of nonanthropogenic noise levels shows that while sustained sources of broadband noise are found in nearly all natural acoustic environments, frequency-averaged ambient noise levels in these environments rarely exceed 70 dB SPL. Similarly, sources reporting ambient noise spectra in natural acoustic environments suggest that noise levels within narrow frequency bands are typically low in intensity (<40 dB SPL). Only in rare instances (e.g., during frog choruses) are ambient noise levels sustained at moderately high intensities ({\textasciitilde}70-90 dB SPL). By contrast, all experiments in which an MOC-mediated protective effect was demonstrated used much higher sound intensities to traumatize the cochlea (100-150 dB SPL). This substantial difference between natural ambient noise levels and the experimental conditions necessary to evoke MOC-mediated protection suggests that even the noisiest natural acoustic environments are not sufficiently intense to have selected for the evolution of the MOC system as a protective mechanism. Furthermore, although relatively intense noise environments do exist in nature, they are insufficiently distributed to account for the widespread distribution of the MOC system in mammals. The paucity of high-intensity noise and the near ubiquity of low-level noise in natural environments supports the hypothesis that the MOC system evolved as a mechanism for "unmasking" biologically significant acoustic stimuli by reducing the response of the cochlea to simultaneous low-level noise. This suggested role enjoys widespread experimental support.},

Am. 111, 2897-2907 (2002)], older subjects benefitted less than younger subjects from momentary improvements in signal-to-noise ratio when listening to speech in interrupted maskers. It has been hypothesized that the benefit derived from interrupted maskers may be related to recovery from forward masking, i.e., the recovery of a response to a suprathreshold signal from prior stimulation by a masker. The effect of interrupted maskers on speech recognition may be well suited to test hypotheses regarding recovery from prior stimulation, given that both involve the perception of signals following a masker. Here, younger and older adults with normal but not identical audiograms listened to nonsense syllables at moderate and high levels in a speech-shaped noise that was modulated by a 2-, 10-, 25-, or 50-Hz square wave. An additional low-level noise was always present that was shaped to produce equivalent masked thresholds for all subjects. To assess recovery from forward masking, forward-masked thresholds were measured at 0.5 and 4.0 kHz as a function of the delay between the speech-shaped masker and the signal. Speech recognition in interrupted noise was poorer for older than younger subjects. Small but consistent age-related differences were observed in the decrease in score with interrupted noise relative to the score without interrupted noise. Forward-masked thresholds of older subjects were higher than those of younger subjects, but there were no age-related differences in the amount of forward masking or in simultaneous masking. Negative correlations were observed between speech-recognition scores in interrupted noise and forward-masked thresholds. That is, the benefit derived from momentary improvements in speech audibility in an interrupted noise decreased as forward-masked thresholds increased. Stronger correlations with forward masking were observed for the higher frequency signal, for higher noise interruption rates, and when the signal-to-noise ratio was poor. Comparisons of speech-recognition scores at moderate and high levels for younger and older subjects were not consistent with the hypothesis of an age-related difference in the contribution of low-spontaneous-rate fibers to speech recognition in interrupted noise.},

Auditory evoked potential (AEP) recordings included all three latency regions: Auditory brain stem responses (ABRs), midlatency responses (MLRs), and long-latency responses (LLRs). Two psychophysical tasks thought to involve temporal processing were used: a monaural-processing task (gap-detection) and a binaural-processing task (masking level difference; MLD). Further, AEP abnormalities and psychophysical performance deficits were related to lesion location, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Reduced MLDs were seen in six MS subjects. Abnormal MLDs were always accompanied by abnormal ABRs and MLRs, and compared to subjects with normal MLDs, the subjects with abnormal MLDs were more likely to have bilateral abnormalities in the AEPs. Further, MLR indices of abnormal binaural interaction appeared to be specifically related to the psychophysical measure of binaural processing. The MRI data of these patients indicated widespread involvement of the auditory pathway. MS subjects with abnormal MRI signals restricted to levels caudal to the lateral lemniscus did not have abnormal MLDs. Gap-detection thresholds were more resistant to the effects of the demyelinating lesions; only two subjects had abnormal gap-detection thresholds. These subjects had extensive AEP abnormalities (bilaterally, in all three latency regions). The gap-detection thresholds were most specifically related to abnormalities of the LLRs. In addition, the subjects with elevated gap-detection thresholds were the only ones with a prolonged interval between the ABRs and MLRs. Thus, efficient neural conduction between the upper brain stem and auditory cortex appears to be crucial for normal monaural temporal processing. The results indicate that demyelinating lesions can cause deficits in temporal processing in the central auditory pathway. However, auditory temporal processing is not a unitary phenomenon since abnormalities at different levels of the auditory system disrupt different types of temporal processing. Finally, abnormal psychophysical performance was not seen in all subjects with AEP and MRI evidence of involvement of the auditory pathway; rather, these psychophysical measures appeared to be sensitive to disruption only in specific portions of the auditory system.},

abstract = {Many listeners with hearing thresholds within the clinically normal range nonetheless complain of difficulty hearing in everyday settings and understanding speech in noise. Converging evidence from human and animal studies points to one potential source of such difficulties: differences in the fidelity with which supra-threshold sound is encoded in the early portions of the auditory pathway. Measures of auditory subcortical steady-state responses (SSSRs) in humans and animals support the idea that the temporal precision of the early auditory representation can be poor even when hearing thresholds are normal. In humans with normal hearing thresholds (NHTs), paradigms that require listeners to make use of the detailed spectro-temporal structure of supra-threshold sound, such as selective attention and discrimination of frequency modulation (FM), reveal individual differences that correlate with subcortical temporal coding precision. Animal studies show that noise exposure and aging can cause a loss of a large percentage of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) without any significant change in measured audiograms. Here, we argue that cochlear neuropathy may reduce encoding precision of supra-threshold sound, and that this manifests both behaviorally and in SSSRs in humans. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that noise-induced neuropathy may be selective for higher-threshold, lower-spontaneous-rate nerve fibers. Based on our hypothesis, we suggest some approaches that may yield particularly sensitive, objective measures of supra-threshold coding deficits that arise due to neuropathy.

abstract = {The 'core deficit' of dyslexia has been characterized by different researchers in terms of either phonological impairments or of difficulties in processing basic visual and auditory stimuli. Recent findings suggest that a single type of impairment in the dynamics of perception, which affects the efficiency of short-term memory, might underlie the broad range of difficulties of dyslexics. Experimental findings show that the general population quickly and automatically tunes around incoming stimuli, 'anchors to them' and performs faster and more accurately when these stimuli are subsequently repeated. Dyslexic individuals fail to benefit from stimulus-specific repetitions. This deficit can account for phonological, working memory, visual and auditory difficulties, in addition to the greater sensitivity of dyslexics to external noise.},

abstract = {This study assessed the acoustic and perceptual effect of noise on vowel and stop-consonant spectra. Multi-talker babble and speech-shaped noise were added to vowel and stop stimuli at -5 to +10 dB S/N, and the effect of noise was quantified in terms of (a) spectral envelope differences between the noisy and clean spectra in three frequency bands, (b) presence of reliable F1 and F2 information in noise, and (c) changes in burst frequency and slope. Acoustic analysis indicated that F1 was detected more reliably than F2 and the largest spectral envelope differences between the noisy and clean vowel spectra occurred in the mid-frequency band. This finding suggests that in extremely noisy conditions listeners must be relying on relatively accurate F1 frequency information along with partial F2 information to identify vowels. Stop consonant recognition remained high even at -5 dB despite the disruption of burst cues due to additive noise, suggesting that listeners must be relying on other cues, perhaps formant transitions, to identify stops.},

abstract = {Stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) have been measured in several different ways, including (1) nonlinear compression, (2) two-tone suppression, and (3) spectral smoothing. Each of the three methods exploits a different cochlear phenomenon or signal-processing technique to extract the emission. The compression method makes use of the compressive growth of emission amplitude relative to the linear growth of the stimulus. The emission is defined as the complex difference between ear-canal pressure measured at one intensity and the rescaled pressure measured at a higher intensity for which the emission is presumed negligible. The suppression method defines the SFOAE as the complex difference between the ear-canal pressure measured with and without a suppressor tone at a nearby frequency. The suppressor tone is presumed to substantially reduce or eliminate the emission. The spectral smoothing method involves convolving the complex ear-canal pressure spectrum with a smoothing function. The analysis exploits the differing latencies of stimulus and emission and is equivalent to windowing in the corresponding latency domain. Although the three methods are generally assumed to yield identical emissions, no equivalence has ever been established. This paper compares human SFOAEs measured with the three methods using procedures that control for temporal drifts, contamination of the calibration by evoked emissions, and other potential confounds. At low stimulus intensities, SFOAEs measured using all three methods are nearly identical. At higher intensities, limitations of the procedures contribute to small differences, although the general spectral shape and phase of the three SFOAEs remain similar. The near equivalence of SFOAEs measured by compression, suppression, and spectral smoothing indicates that SFOAE characteristics are not mere artifacts of measurement methodology.},

The need for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), multiple alternations of conditions, and avoiding middle-ear-muscle activation have been previously highlighted. Less well-known issues include: Contralateral medial OC (MOC) effects may not be good proxies for ipsilateral (ipsi) MOC effects; MOC-induced changes in otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) may not accurately show MOC-induced changes in auditory-nerve (AN) responses; measuring OAE differences from before to after psychophysical trials yields the transient OAE change but not tonic MOC activation; tonic MOC activation may be measurable by several techniques including by OAE differences in trials in which the subject's judgment was correct vs. trials that were incorrect; SNRs can be preserved by Bootstrap statistical tests; differences in task difficulty may outweigh differences in subject attention; lateral efferent effects are little understood and may be tied to MOC effects; to assess whether MOC strength predicts protection from acoustic trauma, prospective tests in humans are needed.},

abstract = {One of the putative functions of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system is to enhance signal detection in noise. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of the MOC system in speech perception in noise. In normal-hearing human listeners, we examined (1) the association between magnitude of MOC inhibition and speech-in-noise performance, and (2) the association between MOC inhibition and the amount of contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS)-induced shift in speech-in-noise acuity. MOC reflex measurements in this study considered critical measurement issues overlooked in past work by: recording relatively low-level, linear click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs), adopting 6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria, and computing normalized CEOAE differences. We found normalized index to be a stable measure of MOC inhibition (mean = 17.21%). MOC inhibition was not related to speech-in-noise performance measured without CAS. However, CAS in a speech-in-noise task caused an SNRSP enhancement (mean = 2.45 dB), and this improvement in speech-in-noise acuity was directly related to their MOC reflex assayed by CEOAEs. Individuals do not necessarily use the available MOC-unmasking characteristic while listening to speech in noise, or do not utilize unmasking to the extent that can be shown by artificial MOC activation. It may be the case that the MOC is not actually used under natural listening conditions and the higher auditory centers recruit MOC-mediated mechanisms only in specific listening conditions-those conditions remain to be investigated.},

abstract = {The auxiliary subunit $\alpha$2$\delta$3 modulates the expression and function of voltage-gated calcium channels. Here we show that $\alpha$2$\delta$3 mRNA is expressed in spiral ganglion neurons and auditory brainstem nuclei and that the protein is required for normal acoustic responses. Genetic deletion of $\alpha$2$\delta$3 led to impaired auditory processing, with reduced acoustic startle and distorted auditory brainstem responses. $\alpha$2$\delta$3(-/-) mice learned to discriminate pure tones, but they failed to discriminate temporally structured amplitude-modulated tones. Light and electron microscopy analyses revealed reduced levels of presynaptic Ca(2+) channels and smaller auditory nerve fiber terminals contacting cochlear nucleus bushy cells. Juxtacellular in vivo recordings of sound-evoked activity in $\alpha$2$\delta$3(-/-) mice demonstrated impaired transmission at these synapses. Together, our results identify a novel role for the $\alpha$2$\delta$3 auxiliary subunit in the structure and function of specific synapses in the mammalian auditory pathway and in auditory processing disorders.},

abstract = {Amplitude modulation (AM) is an important temporal cue for precise speech and complex sound recognition. However, functional decline of the auditory periphery as well as degradation of central auditory processing due to aging can reduce the salience and resolution of temporal cues. Age-related deficits in central temporal processing have previously been observed at more rapid AM frequencies and various AM depths. These centrally observed changes result from cochlear changes compounded with changes along the ascending auditory pathway. In fact, a decrease in ability to detect temporally modulated sounds accurately could originate from changes in cochlear filtering properties and in cochlear mechanics due to aging. Nonetheless, few studies have examined cochlear mechanisms in AM detection. To assess integrity of the mechanical properties of the auditory periphery, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are a tool commonly used in clinics and in research. In this study, we measured DPOAEs to reveal age-related changes in peak f2/f1 ratio and degradation in AM detection by basilar membrane vibration. Two tones (f1 and f2, f2~>~f1) at various f2/f1 ratios and simultaneous presentation of one AM and one pure tone were used as stimuli to evoke DPOAEs. In addition of observing reduced DPOAE amplitudes and steeper slopes in the input-output DPOAE functions, higher peak f2/f1 ratios and broader f2/f1 tuning were also observed in aged animals. Aged animals generally had lower distortion product (DP) and first sideband (SB 1) responses evoked by an f1 pure tone and an f2 AM tone, regardless of whether the AM frequency was 45~Hz or 128~Hz. SB 1 thresholds, which corresponds to the smallest stimulus AM depth that can induce cochlear vibrations at the DP generator locus, were higher in aged animals as well. The results suggest that age-related changes in peak f2/f1 ratio and AM detection by basilar membrane vibration are consistent with a reduction in endocochlear potential and reduced prestin activity but with preserved hair cell bundle function. SB 1 responses evoked by f2 AM/f1 pure tone with various AM depths could serve as an estimate for cochlear AM detection. The sidebands of DP could also serve as additional physiological cues for detection of AM in the presence of other tone(s), even at typical conversational levels in speech.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:The auditory cortex modulates auditory afferents through the olivocochlear system, which innervates the outer hair cells and the afferent neurons under the inner hair cells in the cochlea. Most of the studies that investigated the efferent activity in humans focused on evaluating the suppression of the otoacoustic emissions by stimulating the contralateral ear with noise, which assesses the activation of the medial olivocochlear bundle. The neurophysiology and the mechanisms involving efferent activity on higher regions of the auditory pathway, however, are still unknown. Also, the lack of studies investigating the effects of noise on human auditory cortex, especially in peadiatric population, points to the need for recording the late auditory potentials in noise conditions. Assessing the auditory efferents in schoolaged children is highly important due to some of its attributed functions such as selective attention and signal detection in noise, which are important abilities related to the development of language and academic skills. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of noise on P300 responses of children with normal hearing.

METHODS:P300 was recorded in 27 children aged from 8 to 14 years with normal hearing in two conditions: with and whitout contralateral white noise stimulation.

RESULTS:P300 latencies were significantly longer at the presence of contralateral noise. No significant changes were observed for the amplitude values.

CONCLUSION:Contralateral white noise stimulation delayed P300 latency in a group of school-aged children with normal hearing. These results suggest a possible influence of the medial olivocochlear activation on P300 responses under noise condition.},

abstract = {Because the input signals to the left and right ears are not identical, it is important to clarify the role of these signals in the perception of the vertical angle of a sound source at any position in the upper hemisphere. To obtain basic findings on upper hemisphere localization, this paper investigates the contribution of each pinna to the perception of vertical angle. Tests measured localization of the vertical angle in five planes parallel to the median plane. In the localization tests, the pinna cavities of one or both ears were occluded. Results showed that pinna cavities of both the near and far ears play a role in determining the perceived vertical angle of a sound source in any plane, including the median plane. As a sound source shifts laterally away from the median plane, the contribution of the near ear increases and, conversely, that of the far ear decreases. For saggital planes at azimuths greater than 60 degrees from midline, the far ear no longer contributes measurably to the determination of vertical angle.},

abstract = {CONCLUSION:Otoacoustic emissions generated by outer hair cells (OHCs) are influenced by stimulation of the contralateral ear via a neural pathway involving the olivo-cochlear efferent system. This is often referred to as a contralateral 'suppression reflex', but we suggest that such a term is inappropriate since distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) can be both enhanced and suppressed, and there is continuous modulation with no threshold effects.

OBJECTIVE:To characterize the continuous amplitude modulation of DPOAEs by contralateral sound stimulation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:In an animal model (chinchilla), DPOAEs were recorded in real time from one ear during presentation of acoustic stimuli to the opposite ear.

RESULTS:DPOAE amplitude is suppressed by an increase in contralateral stimulation, and enhanced by a decrease in same, i.e. the emissions are continuously modulated by activity in the opposite ear. The input-output function shows a linear relationship to this system over a 40-50 dB range of contralateral stimulus levels. After a neural delay time of approximately 25 ms, DPOAE amplitude closely follows contralateral amplitude signals up to modulation frequencies of approximately 20 Hz. Thus, stimuli to one ear continually modulate the OHC system (and therefore the biomechanical amplification) of the contralateral cochlea.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that normal-hearing listeners maintain robust speech intelligibility despite severe degradations of amplitude-modulation (AM) cues, by using temporal-envelope information recovered from broadband frequency-modulation (FM) speech cues at the output of cochlear filters. This study aimed to assess whether cochlear damage affects this capacity to reconstruct temporal-envelope information from FM. This was achieved by measuring the ability of 40 normal-hearing listeners and 41 listeners with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to identify syllables processed to degrade AM cues while leaving FM cues intact within three broad frequency bands spanning the range 65-3,645 Hz. Stimuli were presented at 65 dB SPL for both normal-hearing listeners and hearing-impaired listeners. They were presented as such or amplified using a modified half-gain rule for hearing-impaired listeners. Hearing-impaired listeners showed significantly poorer identification scores than normal-hearing listeners at both presentation levels. However, the deficit shown by hearing-impaired listeners for amplified stimuli was relatively modest. Overall, hearing-impaired data and the results of a simulation study were consistent with a poorer-than-normal ability to reconstruct temporal-envelope information resulting from a broadening of cochlear filters by a factor ranging from 2 to 4. These results suggest that mild-to-moderate cochlear hearing loss has only a modest detrimental effect on peripheral, temporal-envelope reconstruction mechanisms.},

abstract = {The dynamics of contralateral acoustic suppression were studied using real time (millisecond resolution) distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in chinchillas and humans. Latency of DPOAE suppression onset is 26 ms in chinchillas and 45 ms in humans. After onset, suppression builds over time before tending to plateau, reflecting a temporal integration process with a time constant of 100 ms (chinchillas). In chinchillas, suppression persists for 40 ms even when elicited by stimuli as short as 5 ms. With stimuli >40 ms, offset and onset latencies are similar and duration of suppression equals that of the contralateral stimulus. A comparison of DPOAE suppression onset latency with neural latency data from the pathways involved suggests the following timing scheme: stimulus onset to activity in (ventral) cochlear nucleus, 4ms (15% of delay); transfer to olivocochlear efferents, 9 ms (35%); efferent conduction to presynaptic OHC site, 4ms (15%); synaptic and mechanical events at OHCs, 9 ms (35% of delay).},

abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate maturation of the medial olivocochlear efferent system (MOCS) in pre- and full-term neonates using Quickscreen (Otodynamics Ltd) and to confirm previous findings on transient otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) suppression in neonates. MOCS maturation was investigated in 46 neonates born at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, using Quickscreen. All neonates were normal with no family history of general or auditory disease and no risk factors for hearing impairment. MOCS function appears gradually in human pre-term neonates and is considered to reach maturity shortly after term birth. The clinical value of MOCS testing in specific populations of newborns at risk for hearing and/or brainstem function can be legitimately raised as activation of the MOCS clearly alters cochlear output. The present results can be interpreted to support the testing of infants at risk of developing abnormal MOCS function using a commercially available rapid TEOAE measurement system.},

abstract = {The medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex arc is probably a three-neuron pathway consisting of type I spiral ganglion neurons, reflex interneurons in the cochlear nucleus, and MOC neurons that project to the outer hair cells of the cochlea. We investigated the identity of MOC reflex interneurons in the cochlear nucleus by assaying their regional distribution using focal injections of kainic acid. Our reflex metric was the amount of change in the distortion product otoacoustic emission (at 2f(1)-f(2)) just after onset of the primary tones. This metric for MOC reflex strength has been shown to depend on an intact reflex pathway. Lesions involving the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN), but not the other subdivisions, produced long-term decreases in MOC reflex strength. The degree of cell loss within the dorsal part of the PVCN was a predictor of whether the lesion affected MOC reflex strength. We suggest that multipolar cells within the PVCN have the distribution and response characteristics appropriate to be the MOC reflex interneurons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to obtain behavioral hearing thresholds for frequencies between 0.125 and 20 kHz from a large population between 10 and 65 yr old using a clinically feasible calibration method expected to compensate well for variations in the distance between the eardrum and an insert-type sound source. Previous reports of hearing thresholds in the extended high frequencies (>8 kHz) have either used calibration techniques known to be inaccurate or specialized equipment not suitable for clinical use.

DESIGN:Hearing thresholds were measured from 352 human subjects between 10 and 65 yr old having clinically normal-hearing thresholds (<20 dB HL) up to 4 kHz. An otoacoustic emission probe fitted with custom sound sources was used, and the stimulus levels individually tailored on the basis of an estimate of the insertion depth of the measurement probe. The calibrated stimulus levels were determined on the basis of measurements made at various depths of insertion in a standard ear simulator. Threshold values were obtained for 21 frequencies between 0.125 and 20 kHz using a modified B{\'e}k{\'e}sy technique. Forty-six of the subjects returned for a second measurement months later from the initial evaluation.

RESULTS:In agreement with previous reports, hearing thresholds at extended high frequencies were found to be sensitive to age-related changes in auditory function. In contrast with previous reports, no gender differences were found in average hearing thresholds at most evaluated frequencies. Two aging processes, one faster than the other in time scale, seem to influence hearing thresholds in different frequency ranges. The standard deviation (SD) of test-retest threshold difference for all evaluated frequencies was 5 to 10 dB, comparable to that reported in the literature for similar measurement techniques but smaller than that observed for data obtained using the standard clinical procedure.

CONCLUSIONS:The depth-compensated ear simulator-based calibration method and the modified B{\'e}k{\'e}sy technique allow reliable measurement of hearing thresholds over the entire frequency range of human hearing. Hearing thresholds at the extended high frequencies are sensitive to aging and reveal subtle differences, which are not evident in the frequency range evaluated regularly ($\le$8 kHz). Previously reported gender-related differences in hearing thresholds may be related to ear-canal acoustics and the calibration procedure and not because of differences in hearing sensitivity.},

abstract = {Objectives: Mediated by the medial olivocochlear system (MOCS), distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels are reduced by presentation of contralateral acoustic stimuli. Such acoustic signals can also evoke a middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR) that also attenuates recorded DPOAE levels. Our aim is to clearly differentiate these two inhibitory mechanisms and to analyze each separately, perhaps allowing the development of novel tests of hearing function. Methods: DPOAE were recorded in real time from chinchillas with normal auditory brainstem response thresholds and middle ear function. Amplitude reduction and its onset latency caused by contralateral presentation of intermittent narrow-band noise (NBN) were measured. Stapedius and tensor tympani muscle tendons were divided without disturbing the ossicular chain, and DPOAE testing was repeated. Results: Peak reduction of (2f1 - f2) DPOAE levels occurred when the center frequency of contralateral NBN approximated the primary tone f2, indicating an f2-frequency-specific response. For a 4.5-kHz centered NBN, DPOAE (f2 = 4.4 kHz) inhibition was 0.1 dB (p < 0.001). This response remained present after tendon division, consistent with an MOCS origin. Low-frequency NBN (center frequency: 0.5 kHz) reduced otoacoustic emission levels (0.1 dB, p < 0.001) across a wide range of DPOAE frequencies. This low-frequency response was abolished by division of the middle ear muscle tendons, clearly indicating MEMR involvement. Conclusions: Following middle ear muscle tendon division, DPOAE inhibition by contralateral stimuli approximating the primary tone f2 persists, whereas responses evoked by lower contralateral frequencies are abolished. This distinguishes the different roles of the MOCS (f2 frequency specific) and MEMR (low frequency only) in contralateral modulation of DPOAE. This analysis helps clarify the pathways involved in an objective test that might have clinical benefit in the testing of neonates. {\textcopyright} 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Four age groups were tested, 4-5 years of age, 6-7 years of age, 9-10 years of age, and adult. Sensitivity to sinuosoidal modulation of a noise carrier (a bandpass noise from 200-1200 Hz) was determined for modulation frequencies of 5, 20, 100, 150, and 200 Hz. The data from all listeners indicated decreasing sensitivity to modulation as a function of increasing frequency of modulation. Time constants were derived from the 3-dB down points of functions that were fitted to the data. No age effects were observed for the derived time constants. However, sensitivity to modulation was found to be reduced in the children 4-5 and 6-7 years of age, as compared to adults, and in the children 4-5 years of age as compared to children 9-10 years of age. The agreement of time constant across all age groups was interpreted as indicating that the peripheral encoding of the temporal envelope is probably adultlike in children aged 4 years and above; however, young children appear to be relatively inefficient in processing the information underlying modulation detection.},

abstract = {In a typical masking situation, two B{\'e}k{\'e}sy waves overlap on the basilar membrane, and each of them initiates a stream of nerve impulses that enters the brain via the auditory nerve. Much is known about the overlapping of the cochlear waves, but much less about where, how, and even if at all, the impulse streams interact once they get inside the brain. In these experiments the incoming impulses are measured electrophysiologically using the auditory brainstem response (ABR), and, simultaneously, using the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (SSR) to monitor events at a probable site of their interaction, the auditory cortex. The principal finding is that, when progressively increasing levels of continuous noise are presented to the contralateral ear, the SSR to the signal drops to about half its control amplitude. Second, low levels of ipsilateral noise reliably enhance SSR amplitude. Third, moderate levels of ipsilateral noise reduce SSR latency. In none of these cases does the ABR show similar effects. These findings are interpreted to mean that, in each case, impulses excited by the signal interact with impulses excited by the noise, and regardless of ear of origin the interactions take place beyond the brainstem level where ABR wave V is generated, either before the impulses reach the cortex, or in the cortex itself.},

abstract = {Auditory brainstem (ABR) and middle latency (MLR) responses were evoked by click and tone-burst stimuli from human neonates. Electrophysiologic evidence of binaural interaction was measured by subtracting waveforms obtained for binaural stimulus conditions from waveforms obtained for the sum of right ear monaural and left ear monaural stimulus conditions. The effects of stimulus level and stimulus frequency on binaural interaction were evaluated by measuring the number, latency and amplitude of components found in the derived binaural interaction waveform, that is, binaural interaction components (BIC). BICs were more prevalent in the latency range of ABRs than for MLRs. Click and tonal stimuli were equally effective for deriving ABR-BICs, while tone-bursts were somewhat less effective than clicks for deriving MLR-BICs. Stimulus-response dependencies for ABR and MLR component latencies were apparent in monaural, binaural and binaural interaction waveforms. Normalized amplitudes for BICs showed that low-frequency tone-burst stimuli resulted in the largest values compared to click and high-frequency tonal stimuli. Comparison of these results with published results from adults demonstrated immaturity of binaural interaction in neonates.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown a loss in the precision of horizontal localization responses of older hearing-impaired (HI) individuals, along with potentially poorer neural representations of sound-source location. These deficits could be the result or corollary of greater difficulties in discriminating spatial images, and the insensitivity to punctate sound sources. This hypothesis was tested in three headphone-presentation experiments varying interaural coherence (IC), the cue most associated with apparent auditory source width. First, thresholds for differences in IC were measured for a broad sampling of participants. Older HI participants were significantly worse at discriminating IC across reference values than younger normal-hearing participants. These results are consistent with senescent increases in temporal jitter. Performance decreased with age, a finding corroborated in a second discrimination experiment using a separate group of participants matched for hearing loss. This group also completed a third, visual experiment, with both a cross-mapping task where they drew the size of the sound they heard and the identification task where they chose the image that best corresponded to what they heard. The results from the visual tasks indicate that older HI individuals do not hear punctate images and are relatively insensitive to changes in width based on IC.},

abstract = {It has been shown that electrical stimulation of the efferent auditory system can influence neural tuning curves in animals. Here, we examined a psychophysical analog of this effect in humans. All of the 19 normally hearing subjects showed a reduction in the amplitude of otoacoustic emissions in one ear when contralateral broadband noise was presented, indicating a functioning efferent system. Psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) were measured in simultaneous masking in the absence and presence of contralateral stimulation (CS). The CS was a continuous narrowband noise centered at the signal frequency and presented at a level of 50 or 60 dB SL. The CS had no consistent effect on the masker level at the tips of the PTCs. For the two highest signal frequencies (2000 and 4000 Hz), the CS reduced the masker level required for threshold on both the low- and high-frequency sides of the PTCs, and the sharpness of tuning, as measured by Q10, decreased significantly. For the two lowest signal frequencies (500 and 1000 Hz), the masker level required for threshold on the low-frequency sides of the PTCs increased with CS, and the Q10 values increased significantly. The general pattern of the results was consistent with that observed for electrical stimulation of the efferent system in animals.},

abstract = {Inhibition of cochlear amplifier gain by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system has several putative roles: aiding listening in noise, protection against damage from acoustic overexposure, and slowing age-induced hearing loss. The human MOC reflex has been studied almost exclusively by measuring changes in otoacoustic emissions. However, to help understand how the MOC system influences what we hear, it is important to have measurements of the MOC effect on the total output of the organ of Corti, i.e., on cochlear nerve responses that couple sounds to the brain. In this work we measured the inhibition produced by the MOC reflex on the amplitude of cochlear nerve compound action potentials (CAPs) in response to moderate level (52-60~dB peSPL) clicks from five, young, normal hearing, awake, alert, human adults. MOC activity was elicited by 65~dB SPL, contralateral broadband noise (CAS). Using tympanic membrane electrodes, approximately 10~h of data collection were needed from each subject to yield reliable measurements of the MOC reflex inhibition on CAP amplitudes from one click level. The CAS produced a 16% reduction of CAP amplitude, equivalent to a 1.98~dB effective attenuation (averaged over five subjects). Based on previous reports of efferent effects as functions of level and frequency, it is possible that much larger effective attenuations would be observed at lower sound levels or with clicks of higher frequency content. For a preliminary comparison, we also measured MOC reflex inhibition of DPOAEs evoked from the same ears with f2's near 4~kHz. The resulting effective attenuations on DPOAEs were, on average, less than half the effective attenuations on CAPs.},

abstract = {The superior olivary complex (SOC) is part of the auditory brainstem of the vertebrate brain. Residing ventrally in the rhombencephalon, it receives sensory signals from both cochleae through multisynaptic pathways. Neurons of the SOC are also a target of bilateral descending projections. Ascending and descending efferents of the SOC affect the processing of auditory signals on both sides of the brainstem and in both organs of Corti. The pattern of connectivity indicates that the SOC fulfills functions of binaural signal integration serving sound localization. But whereas many of these connectional features are shared with the inferior colliculus (with the important exception of a projection to the inner ear), cellular and molecular investigations have shown that cells residing in SOC are unique in several respects. Unlike those of other auditory brainstem nuclei, they specifically express molecules known to be involved in development, plasticity, and learning (e.g., GAP-43 mRNA, specific subunits of integrin). Moreover, neurons of the SOC in adult mammals respond to various kinds of hearing impairment with the expression of plasticity-related substances (e.g., GAP-43, c-Jun, c-Fos, cytoskeletal elements), indicative of a restructuring of auditory connectivity. These observations suggest that the SOC is pivotal in the developmental and adaptive tuning of binaural processing in young and adult vertebrates.},

abstract = {The medial olivocochlear (MOC) bundle reduces the gain of the cochlear amplifier through reflexive activation by sound. Physiological results indicate that MOC-induced reduction in cochlear gain can enhance the response to signals when presented in masking noise. Some previous studies suggest that this "antimasking" effect of the MOC system plays a role in speech-in-noise perception. The present study set out to reinvestigate this hypothesis by correlating measures of MOC activity and speech-in-noise processing across a group of normal-hearing participants. MOC activity was measured using contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and speech-in-noise processing was measured by measuring the effect of noise masking on performance in a consonant-vowel (CV) discrimination task and on auditory brain stem responses evoked by a CV syllable. Whereas there was a significant correlation between OAE suppression and both measures of speech-in-noise processing, the direction of this correlation was opposite to that predicted by the antimasking hypothesis, in that individuals with stronger OAE suppression tended to show greater noise-masking effects on CV processing. The current results indicate that reflexive MOC activation is not always beneficial to speech-in-noise processing. We propose an alternative to the antimasking hypothesis, whereby the MOC system benefits speech-in-noise processing through dynamic (e.g., attention- and experience-dependent), rather than reflexive, control of cochlear gain.},

abstract = {Musical training is known to modify cortical organization. Here, we show that such modifications extend to subcortical sensory structures and generalize to processing of speech. Musicians had earlier and larger brainstem responses than nonmusician controls to both speech and music stimuli presented in auditory and audiovisual conditions, evident as early as 10 ms after acoustic onset. Phase-locking to stimulus periodicity, which likely underlies perception of pitch, was enhanced in musicians and strongly correlated with length of musical practice. In addition, viewing videos of speech (lip-reading) and music (instrument being played) enhanced temporal and frequency encoding in the auditory brainstem, particularly in musicians. These findings demonstrate practice-related changes in the early sensory encoding of auditory and audiovisual information.},

abstract = {Conductive hearing loss attenuates and delays sound passing through the middle ear. This impairs binaural hearing and other central auditory functions dependent on high fidelity sound transmission. Persistent conductive loss leads to central impairments that persist after the peripheral loss has resolved. For example, children who have had multiple episodes of otitis media with effusion (OME) in the first few years of life may have poor detection of sounds in noisy environments, evidenced by reduced binaural unmasking (BU). Recent research shows that a 'threshold' level of OME is required to produce impaired BU. Children who had OME in one or both ears for more than about 50% of the first 5 years had reduced BU. Animal research, using long-term ear plugging, suggests that total OME duration, rather than age at the time of having the disease, determines its effect on BU. Animals reared with bilateral (but not unilateral) ear plugs also have poor auditory temporal resolution, and reduced sensitivity to short tones in the presence of background noise, after plug removal. However, given time (6-24 months) and training, all animals regained normal temporal resolution.},

The syllables, heard as /ba/, /da/, or /ga/, included a 25-, 50-, or 75-ms formant transition followed by a segment of steady-state vowel. The data were analyzed in terms of average discharge rate and in terms of the synchrony of discharges with respect to various spectral components of the stimuli. The results differ slightly from those of previous reports of the responses to vowels [Sachs and Young, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 66, 470-479 (1979); Young and Sachs, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 66, 1381-1403 (1979)], in that average discharge rates appear to provide more information about the spectra of formant transitions than they do about the spectra of steady-state vowels. This difference reflects changes in the spectrum of the syllable produced by movements of the formants. The synchrony of discharges, however, may provide more detailed information about the spectra of CVs than does average discharge rate. Each fiber's response at a particular peristimulus time may be characterized by the "dominant response component," the largest peak in the Fourier transform of the period histogram. The trajectories of the first three formants can be inferred from changes in the "dominant components" in a sample of fibers.},

abstract = {Corticofugal pathways originating in auditory cortex innervate most subcortical auditory nuclei in the ascending pathway [Auditory Neurosci. 1 (1995) 287-308; J. Comp. Neurol. 371 (1996) 15-40]. Our goal is to determine if these projections arise from the same neurons or if different neurons project to each of the separate structures. We also seek to identify the layers and fields of auditory cortex from which these neurons originate. In the present study, we answer these questions with respect to the projections to the superior olivary complex (SOC). Fluorescent retrograde tracers, Fast Blue (FB) or Diamidino Yellow (DiY), were injected into the SOC and the pattern of labeled cells was determined in temporal neocortex. We also injected FB into the granule cell domain (GCD) of the cochlear nucleus. Cortical projections to the GCD derive exclusively from layer V pyramidal cells in primary auditory cortex [Brain Res. 706 (1996) 97-102]. Thus the pattern of labeling produced by injections in the GCD provided a reference for interpreting the labeling after SOC injections. Layer V pyramidal cells project to the SOC, and these neurons were distributed bilaterally in primary and secondary areas of auditory cortex. The projections to the SOC from primary auditory cortex are predominantly uncrossed, whereas those from secondary auditory cortex are nearly equal for the two hemispheres. In animals that received injections of FB in the GCD and DiY in the SOC, cells labeled by each injection had a different laminar distribution and very few cells were double labeled. These data suggest that the cortical pathways ending in the cochlear nucleus and SOC are largely independent. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the multifunctional nature of the SOC in brainstem auditory processing.},

abstract = {1. Outer hair cells (OHCs) have active micromechanical properties that are thought to be the origin of evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs). In the present study, click-evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded in humans with or without various contralateral acoustic stimulations. A previous study, concentrating on contralateral stimulation with broadband noise, had shown a decrease of the EOAE amplitude in humans. Results support a role for the efferent system in cochlear mechanics; indeed, medial efferent neurons of the olivocochlear bundle terminate on the OHCs. To obtain a better understanding of the medial efferent system functioning in humans, the present study looked at the contralateral suppressive effect as a function of stimulus parameters. 2. The study of the input-output function of the EOAE amplitude with and without a 50-dB SPL contralateral broadband noise showed that the suppressive effect was equivalent to a mean reduction of 3.77 dB. 3. For the EOAEs to tone pips, the contralateral suppressive effect was strongest when the contralateral ear stimuli were narrow bands that were centered around the central EOAE frequency. This frequency specificity disappeared for contralateral narrow band noise levels greater than 50 dB SPL. 4. The contralateral suppressive effect was also observed with transient contralateral sounds (nonfiltered clicks). Significant reductions of the EOAE amplitude were seen with contralateral click levels as low as 17.5 dB SL. Above this level, the EOAE amplitude decreased as the contralateral stimulus level increased. This effect was still present in subjects without any stapedial reflex, but absent in total unilateral hearing-loss subjects. Therefore this suppressive effect is unlikely to be due to alteration of the middle ear function or to transcranially conducted sound. 5. When the contralateral interclick interval exceeded 14.2 ms. the suppressive effect was smaller. With contralateral stimulus level maintained subjectively constant, the effect was found to disappear when the interclick interval was greater than 49.9 ms. A saturation of the contralateral suppressive effect was observed for click rates greater than 70/s (interclick interval less than 14.2 ms). 6. Our study confirms and specifies the contralateral sound suppression effect on cochlear mechanisms in humans, assessing the equivalent reduction, showing a frequency specificity and extending these findings to contralateral transient sounds. Any influence of the acoustic crosstalk was eliminated. A role played by middle ear muscles cannot be absolutely ruled out but is not necessary to produce such a contralateral suppressive effect (the effect being found in subjects after surgical removal of the stapedius muscle) and could not explain the frequency specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Mammalian hearing is a complex special sense that involves detection, localization, and identification of the auditory stimulus. The cerebral cortex may subserve higher auditory processes by providing direct modulatory cortical projections to the auditory brainstem. To support the hypothesis that corticofugal projections are a conserved feature in the mammalian brain, this article reviews features of the rat corticofugal pathway and presents new data supporting the presence of similar projections in the mouse. The mouse auditory cortex was localized with electrophysiological recording and neuronal tracers were injected into AI. The cochlear nucleus was dissected and examined for terminal fibers by light and electron microscopy. Bouton endings were found bilaterally forming synapses with dendrites of granule cells of the cochlear nucleus. This report provides evidence for direct auditory cortex projections to the cochlear nucleus in the mouse. The distribution of projections to the granule cell domain and the synapses onto granule cell dendrites are consistent with what has been reported for rats and guinea pigs. These findings suggest a general plan for corticofugal modulation of ascending auditory information in mammals. Corticobulbar inputs to the auditory brainstem likely provided a survival advantage by improving sound detection and identification, thus allowing the development of complex social behaviors and the navigation of varied environments.},

abstract = {1. We studied the sensitivity of cells in the medial superior olive (MSO) of the anesthetized cat to variations in interaural phase differences (IPDs) of low-frequency tones and in interaural time differences (ITDs) of tones and broad-band noise signals. Our sample consisted of 39 cells histologically localized to the MSO. 2. All but one of the cells had characteristic frequencies less than 3 kHz, and 79% were sensitive to ITDs and IPDs. More than one-half (56%) of the cells responded to monaural stimulation of either ear, and both the binaural and monaural responses were highly phase locked. All of the cells that were sensitive to IPDs and monaurally driven by either ear responded in accord with that predicted by the coincidence model of Jeffress, as judged by comparisons of the phases at which the monaural and binaural responses occurred. The optimal IPDs were tightly clustered between 0.0 and 0.2 cycles. Most cells exhibited facilitation of the response at favorable ITDs and inhibition at unfavorable ITDs compared with the monaural responses. 3. Cells in the MSO exhibited characteristic delay, as judged by a linear relationship between the mean interaural phase and stimulating frequency. Characteristic phases were clustered near 0 indicating the most cells responded maximally when the two input tones were in phase. With the use of the binaural beat stimulus we found no differential selectivity for either the direction or speed of interaural phase changes. 4. The cells were also sensitive to ITDs of broad-band noise signals. The ITD curve in response to broad-band noise was similar to that predicted by the composite curve, which was calculated by linearly summating the tonal responses over the frequencies in the response area of the cell. Most (93%) of the peaks of the composite curves were between 0 and +400 microseconds, corresponding to locations in the contralateral sound field. Moreover, computer cross correlations of the monaural spike trains were similar to the ITD curve generated binaurally for both correlated and uncorrelated noise signals to the two ears. Thus our data suggest that the cells in the MSO behave much like cross-correlators. 5. By combining data from different animals and lcoating each cell on a standard MSO, we found evidence for a spatial map of ITDs across the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the MSO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Measurements were taken with one target collocated with two maskers, or with maskers flanking the target by +/-20 degrees. For 80% of trials, the target was played from the attended location ("expected"), and 20% came from another ("unexpected") location. For collocated stimuli, SRTs worsened with increasing distance from the expected location by 2.1 dB over the 60 degrees azimuth and by 5.1 dB for spatially separated target and maskers. In spatially separated conditions, a 2.9-dB change was still found when gaze was away from the attended location. Spatial attention appears to increase speech intelligibility against interferers, with gain decreasing with distance from the focus of attention. Spatial release from masking (RFM) was only found for the attended location. Further experiments suggest that target location uncertainty prevented RFM at unattended locations.},

With sources distributed on the horizontal plane, the mean MAA threshold was 0.97 degrees. With the sources distributed on the vertical plane (array rotated 90 degrees), the mean MAA threshold was 3.65 degrees. Performance in both conditions was well in line with previous experiments of this type. Tests were also conducted with sources distributed on oblique planes. As the array was rotated from 10 degrees-60 degrees from the horizontal plane, relatively little change in the MAA threshold was observed; the mean MAA thresholds ranged from 0.78 degrees to 1.06 degrees. Only when the array was nearly vertical (80 degrees) was there any appreciable loss in spatial resolution; the MAA threshold had increased to 1.8 degrees. The relevance of these results to research on auditory localization under natural listening conditions, especially in the presence of head movements, is also discussed.},

abstract = {The present study aimed at characterizing the suppressing effect of contralateral medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents on human auditory sensitivity and mechanical cochlear responses at sound levels near behavioral thresholds. Absolute thresholds for pure tones of 500 and 4000 Hz with durations between 10-500 ms were measured in the presence and in the absence of a contralateral broadband noise. The intensity of the noise was fixed at 60 dB SPL to evoke the contralateral MOC reflex without evoking the middle-ear muscle reflex. In agreement with previously reported findings, thresholds measured without the contralateral noise decreased with increasing tone duration, and the rate of decrease was faster at 500 than at 4000 Hz. Contralateral stimulation increased thresholds by 1.07 and 1.72 dB at 500 and 4000 Hz, respectively. The mean increase (1.4 dB) just missed statistical significance (p = 0.08). Importantly, the across-frequency mean threshold increase was significantly greater for long than for short probes. This effect was more obvious at 4000 Hz than at 500 Hz. Assuming that thresholds depend on the MOC-dependent cochlear mechanical response followed by an MOC-independent, post-mechanical detection mechanism, the present results at 4000 Hz suggest that MOC efferent activation suppresses cochlear mechanical responses more at lower than at higher intensities across the range of intensities near threshold, while the results at 500 Hz suggest comparable mechanical suppression across the threshold intensity range. The results are discussed in the context of central masking and of auditory models of efferent suppression of cochlear mechanical responses.},

abstract = {For normal-hearing listeners, masked speech recognition can improve with the introduction of masker amplitude modulation. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that this masking release is due in part to an interaction between the temporal distribution of cues necessary to perform the task and the probability of those cues temporally coinciding with masker modulation minima. Stimuli were monosyllabic words masked by speech-shaped noise, and masker modulation was introduced via multiplication with a raised sinusoid of 2.5-40 Hz. Tasks included detection, three-alternative forced-choice identification, and open-set identification. Overall, there was more masking release associated with the closed than the open-set tasks. The best rate of modulation also differed as a function of task; whereas low modulation rates were associated with best performance for the detection and three-alternative identification tasks, performance improved with modulation rate in the open-set task. This task-by-rate interaction was also observed when amplitude-modulated speech was presented in a steady masker, and for low- and high-pass filtered speech presented in modulated noise. These results were interpreted as showing that the optimal rate of amplitude modulation depends on the temporal distribution of speech cues and the information required to perform a particular task.},

abstract = {The binaural interaction components (BIC) of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), auditory middle latency response (AMLR), and auditory late latency response (ALLR) are representations of binaural processing throughout the auditory system. The present article reviews the characteristics of the BIC with respect to binaural psychophysical phenomena, development, and aging, and explores its clinical application. The BIC correlates well with gross psychophysical measures of binaural processing. In the ABR, the BIC is consistent with a percept of binaural fusion; additional factors may contribute to the BIC in later responses. The BIC is not completely mature at birth and tends to decline in later years of life. Promising clinical applications are the measurement of maturation of binaural processing, and identification of pathology of the binaural system. Further research is needed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio before the BIC can be used clinically for diagnostic assessment. },

abstract = {A click-evoked otoacoustic emission (CEOAE) has group delay and spread as first- and second-order temporal moments varying over frequency, and instantaneous frequency and bandwidth as first- and second-order spectral moments varying over time. Energy-smoothed moments were calculated from a CEOAE database over 0.5-15 kHz bandwidth and 0.25-20 ms duration. Group delay and instantaneous frequency were calculated without phase unwrapping using a coherence synchrony measure that accurately classified ears with hearing loss. CEOAE moment measurements were repeatable in individual ears. Group delays were similar for CEOAEs and stimulus-frequency OAEs. Group spread is a frequency-specific measure of temporal spread in an emission, related to spatial spread across tonotopic generation sites along the cochlea. In normal ears, group delay and spread increased with frequency and decreased with level. A direct measure of cochlear tuning above 4 kHz was analyzed using instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. Synchronized spontaneous OAEs were present in most ears below 4 kHz, and confounded interpretation of moments. In ears with sensorineural hearing loss, group delay and spread varied with audiometric classification and amount of hearing loss; group delay differed between older males and females. CEOAE moments reveal clinically relevant information on cochlear tuning in ears with normal and impaired hearing.},

abstract = {The inner ear can be made less vulnerable to acoustic injury by a "conditioning" treatment involving exposure to a moderate-level acoustic stimulus before the acoustic overexposure. The present study was designed to explore the role of the olivocochlear (OC) system in this "protection." Guinea pigs were divided into a number of groups: some (trauma-only) were exposed to a traumatic noise for 4 h at 109 dB SPL; others (condition/trauma) were conditioned by daily exposure to the same noise at 85 dB SPL before the traumatic exposure. In OC-intact animals, the condition/trauma group showed significantly less permanent threshold shift (PTS) than the trauma-only group as measured via compound action potentials and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Other animals with identical noise-exposure regimens underwent deefferentation surgery before the start of conditioning: the OC bundle (OCB) was cut in the brain stem, either at the midline (cutting the crossed OCB to both ears) or at the sulcus limitans (cutting all OC fibers to 1 side). Lesion success was quantified by measuring OC fascicles to the outer hair cell region in each ear. The results from the surgical groups showed that total loss of the OCB significantly increased the noise-induced PTS, whereas loss of the COCB only did not; that the conditioning exposure in deefferented animals increased, rather than decreased, the PTS from the traumatic exposure; and that animals undergoing sham surgery (brain stem cuts that failed to transect the OCB) appeared protected whether or not they received the conditioning noise exposure. The latter result suggests that conditioning-related protection may arise from a generalized stress response, which can be elicited by noise exposure, brain surgery, or a variety of other means. The former results make an OC role in the conditioning process, per se, difficult to assess, given the large effects of OC activity on general acoustic vulnerability.},

abstract = {Relationships between click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) and behavioral thresholds have not been explored above 5 kHz due to limitations in CEOAE measurement procedures. New techniques were used to measure behavioral thresholds and CEOAEs up to 16 kHz. A long cylindrical tube of 8 mm diameter, serving as a reflectionless termination, was used to calibrate audiometric stimuli and design a wideband CEOAE stimulus. A second click was presented 15 dB above a probe click level that varied over a 44 dB range, and a nonlinear residual procedure extracted a CEOAE from these click responses. In some subjects (age 14-29 years) with normal hearing up to 8 kHz, CEOAE spectral energy and latency were measured up to 16 kHz. Audiometric thresholds were measured using an adaptive yes-no procedure. Comparison of CEOAE and behavioral thresholds suggested a clinical potential of using CEOAEs to screen for high-frequency hearing loss. CEOAE latencies determined from the peak of averaged, filtered temporal envelopes decreased to 1 ms with increasing frequency up to 16 kHz. Individual CEOAE envelopes included both compressively growing longer-delay components consistent with a coherent-reflection source and linearly or expansively growing shorter-delay components consistent with a distortion source. Envelope delays of both components were approximately invariant with level.},

P. Feeney {\&} D. H. Keefe, 2001). The wideband technique incorporates both a correlation method to assess the pattern of the reflex-induced shifts in reflectance and admittance across frequency and a magnitude method to determine if the amplitude of the shifts exceeds baseline variability. Contralateral reflex thresholds for 1000- and 2000-Hz activators were obtained for 34 young adults with both the wideband method and a clinical method using a 226 Hz probe tone. Average reflex thresholds obtained with the new method were 12 to 13.7 dB lower than than obtained with the clinical method. When the bandwidth of analysis of admittance and reflectance responses was limited to 250 to 2000 Hz, the reduction in reflex thresholds was accompanied by the rejection of 96% of nonactivator-baseline responses as reflexes. The method holds promise for extending reflex threshold testing to patients with reflexes elevated beyond current equipment limits, for reducing the sound levels used in reflex testing, and for obtaining sensitive measures of reflex threshold in infants.},

abstract = {There is a non-linear interaction of binaural stimulation on auditory brain-stem potentials in both human and animals. The interaction takes the form of the binaurally evoked ABR being of smaller amplitude than the sum of the monaurally evoked ABRs. In the guinea pig this interaction occurs at the time of components P4, N4 and P5. In order to investigate the generator sites of binaural interaction in the ABR, various lesions were made in the brain-stem auditory system in 29 guinea pigs. The effects of those lesions on binaural interaction were as follows: (1) unilateral lesion of lateral lemniscus or bilateral lesions of the inferior colliculi had no significant effect on binaural interaction; (2) transection of the lateral lemnisci bilaterally was associated with a loss of the component of binaural interaction associated in time with N4; (3) a lesion just lateral to the lateral superior olivary complex resulted in an attenuation of the component of binaural interaction associated in time with P4; (4) complete section of the decussating fibers of the trapezoid body or a complete unilateral lesion of the superior olivary complex led to a loss of all components of binaural interaction. These results suggest that binaural interaction in the guinea pig ABR requires the integrity of several distinct portions of the brain-stem auditory pathway, i.e., both lateral lemnisci are required for the interaction occurring at the time of N4; the brain-stem just lateral to the lateral superior olive participates in the interaction at the time of P4. The trapezoid body and superior olivary nucleus are required for binaural interaction at P4, N4 and P5.},

In Experiment 1 (signal uncertainty) the signal was randomly at 501 or 2818 Hz. The majority of the adult listeners showed a slight decrement in performance consistent with an ability to monitor both frequencies simultaneously. The majority of the children, however, showed no decrement in performance, suggesting that the children may not have focused attention at the signal frequency even when it was fixed. In Experiment 2 (masker uncertainty), random-frequency, random-level, tonal distracters were added to each interval of the 2 alternative-forced-choice (2afc) procedure. The effect of masker uncertainty was much larger than that of signal uncertainty. For most of the adult listeners and some of the children, the distracters produced higher thresholds (on average by 10 dB) and shallower psychometric function slopes. For most of the children, thresholds increased by 20 dB or more and psychometric functions were often nearly flat.},

abstract = {Efferent neurones within the intraganglionic spiral bundle of the guinea pig cochlea were characterized in terms of their response properties, and their pattern of termination within the receptor organ revealed by intracellular labelling with horseradish peroxidase. All neurones subsequently identified as efferent neurones had clear features of their response properties which distinguished them from primary auditory afferents. They had long latency, low maximum discharge rate and low levels of spontaneous activity under Nembutal/Innovar anaesthesia. The pattern of discharge was extremely regular, revealed by symmetrical interspike interval histograms. 49.4% responded best to ipsilateral, 43.3% to contralateral sound and a third group of 7.3% responded equally well to either ipsilateral or contralateral sound. In cochleae in good physiological condition, these efferents were as sensitive and as sharply tuned as primary afferents with the same characteristic frequencies (CFs). All efferents fully traced in histological processing terminated on the outer hair cells. Several efferents showed extensive branching beneath the inner hair cells which might represent en passant synapses with other neuronal elements. There was clear evidence of tonotopic organization of the efferent projection. The site of termination on the outer hair cells in most instances was very close to the region of the cochlea predicted from the fibres' CF and the known place-frequency map for primary afferent neurones in the guinea pig.},

A principal components analysis of the resulting 5300 HRTF magnitude functions revealed that the HRTFs can be modeled as a linear combination of five basic spectral shapes (basis functions), and that this representation accounts for approximately 90% of the variance in the original HRTF magnitude functions. HRTF phase was modeled by assuming that HRTFs are minimum-phase functions and that interaural phase differences can be approximated by a simple time delay. Subjects' judgments of the apparent directions of headphone-presented sounds that had been synthesized from the modeled HRTFs were nearly identical to their judgments of sounds synthesized from measured HRTFs. With fewer than five basis functions used in the model, a less faithful reconstruction of the HRTF was produced, and the frequency of large localization errors increased dramatically.},

abstract = {Previous psychoacoustical and physiological studies indicate that the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR), a bilateral, sound-evoked reflex, may lead to improved sound intensity discrimination in background noise. The MOCR can decrease the range of basilar-membrane compression and can counteract effects of neural adaptation from background noise. However, the contribution of these processes to intensity discrimination is not well understood. This study examined the effect of ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral noise on the "mid-level hump." The mid-level hump refers to intensity discrimination Weber fractions (WFs) measured for short-duration, high-frequency tones which are poorer at mid levels than at lower or higher levels. The mid-level hump WFs may reflect a limitation due to basilar-membrane compression, and thus may be decreased by the MOCR. The noise was either short (50 ms) or long (150 ms), with the long noise intended to elicit the sluggish MOCR. For a tone in quiet, mid-level hump WFs improved with ipsilateral noise for most listeners, but not with contralateral noise. For a tone in ipsilateral noise, WFs improved with contralateral noise for most listeners, but only when both noises were long. These results are consistent with MOCR-induced WF improvements, possibly via decreases in effects of compression and neural adaptation.},

abstract = {The experimental observation of long- and short-latency components in both stimulus-frequency and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions admits a comprehensive explanation within the coherent reflection mechanism, in a linear active transmission-line cochlear model. A local complex reflectivity function associated with roughness was defined and analyzed by varying the tuning factor of the model, systematically showing, for each frequency, a multiple-peak spatial structure, compatible with the observed multiple-latency structure of otoacoustic emissions. Although this spatial pattern and the peak relative intensity changes with the chosen random roughness function, the multiple-peak structure is a reproducible feature of different "digital ears," in good agreement with experimental data. If one computes the predicted transmission delays as a function of frequency and position for each source, one gets a good match to the latency-frequency patterns that are directly computed from synthesized otoacoustic spectra using time-frequency analysis. This result clarifies the role of the spatial distribution of the otoacoustic emission sources, further supporting the interpretation of different-latency otoacoustic components as due to reflection sources localized at different places along the basilar membrane.},

abstract = {We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions.

abstract = {The Springer Handbook of Auditory Research presents a series of compreh- sive and synthetic reviews of the fundamental topics in modern auditory - search. The volumes are aimed at all individuals with interests in hearing research including advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and clinical investigators. The volumes are intended to introduce new investigators to important aspects of hearing science and to help established investigators to better understand the fundamental theories and data in ?elds of hearing that they may not normally follow closely. Each volume presents a particular topic comprehensively, and each serves as a synthetic overview and guide to the literature. As such, the chapters present neither exhaustive data reviews nor original research that has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed journals. The volumes focus on topics that have developed a solid data and conceptual foundation rather than on those for which a literature is only beginning to develop. New research areas will be covered on a timely basis in the series as they begin to mature.},

abstract = {Harmonic complex tones elicit a pitch sensation at their fundamental frequency (F0), even when their spectrum contains no energy at F0, a phenomenon known as "pitch of the missing fundamental." The strength of this pitch percept depends upon the degree to which individual harmonics are spaced sufficiently apart to be "resolved" by the mechanical frequency analysis in the cochlea. We investigated the resolvability of harmonics of missing-fundamental complex tones in the auditory nerve (AN) of anesthetized cats at low and moderate stimulus levels and compared the effectiveness of two representations of pitch over a much wider range of F0s (110-3,520 Hz) than in previous studies. We found that individual harmonics are increasingly well resolved in rate responses of AN fibers as the characteristic frequency (CF) increases. We obtained rate-based estimates of pitch dependent upon harmonic resolvability by matching harmonic templates to profiles of average discharge rate against CF. These estimates were most accurate for F0s above 400-500 Hz, where harmonics were sufficiently resolved. We also derived pitch estimates from all-order interspike-interval distributions, pooled over our entire sample of fibers. Such interval-based pitch estimates, which are dependent on phase-locking to the harmonics, were accurate for F0s below 1,300 Hz, consistent with the upper limit of the pitch of the missing fundamental in humans. The two pitch representations are complementary with respect to the F0 range over which they are effective; however, neither is entirely satisfactory in accounting for human psychophysical data.},

abstract = {The speech-reception threshold (SRT) for sentences presented in a fluctuating interfering background sound of 80 dBA SPL is measured for 20 normal-hearing listeners and 20 listeners with sensorineural hearing impairment. The interfering sounds range from steady-state noise, via modulated noise, to a single competing voice. Two voices are used, one male and one female, and the spectrum of the masker is shaped according to these voices. For both voices, the SRT is measured as well in noise spectrally shaped according to the target voice as shaped according to the other voice. The results show that, for normal-hearing listeners, the SRT for sentences in modulated noise is 4-6 dB lower than for steady-state noise; for sentences masked by a competing voice, this difference is 6-8 dB. For listeners with moderate sensorineural hearing loss, elevated thresholds are obtained without an appreciable effect of masker fluctuations. The implications of these results for estimating a hearing handicap in everyday conditions are discussed. By using the articulation index (AI), it is shown that hearing-impaired individuals perform poorer than suggested by the loss of audibility for some parts of the speech signal. Finally, three mechanisms are discussed that contribute to the absence of unmasking by masker fluctuations in hearing-impaired listeners. The low sensation level at which the impaired listeners receive the masker seems a major determinant. The second and third factors are: reduced temporal resolution and a reduction in comodulation masking release, respectively.},

The cells become shorter in response to depolarizing and longer in response to hyperpolarizing currents in the synaptic end of the cell. The cells respond with either an increase or decrease in length to transcellular alternating current stimulation. The direction of the movement with transcellular stimuli appears to be frequency dependent. Iontophoretic application of acetylcholine to the synaptic end of the cell decreases its length. The microarchitecture of the organ of Corti permits length changes of outer hair cells in a manner that could significantly influence the mechanics of the cochlear partition and thereby contribute to the exquisite sensitivity of mammalian hearing.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to examine the ability of human listeners to localize the "lag" or "echo" source in a precedence effect paradigm. A 5-ms noise burst was presented from a source located between 554-279 cm from the subject. This "lead" source was always located at 0 degrees azimuth. At the same time, one of two sources located at a distance of 610 cm from the subject was also activated with the same 5-ms noise burst. The subject's task was to identify which lag source had been active. Across sessions, the angular distance between the lag sources was varied, so as to allow a determination of the minimum audible angle (MAA) that could be resolved. Tests were run in a room designed to minimize reflections and in a hallway that was acoustically quite complex. No systematic differences in MAA thresholds were observed as a function of the environment employed. MAA thresholds obtained without the signal from the lead speaker were less than 1 degree for four of the five subjects tested. The precedence effect, as measured by the change in the MAA threshold, appears to have only a modest influence on localization performance. Under conditions in which the lead source was concurrently active, the thresholds were generally elevated by only 2 degrees-4 degrees. A reduction of this magnitude in the ability to resolve the position of the lag source does not seem to be sufficient, in itself, to account for the excellent localization performance frequently observed in reflective environments.},

abstract = {Do listeners process noisy speech by taking advantage of "glimpses"-spectrotemporal regions in which the target signal is least affected by the background? This study used an automatic speech recognition system, adapted for use with partially specified inputs, to identify consonants in noise. Twelve masking conditions were chosen to create a range of glimpse sizes. Several different glimpsing models were employed, differing in the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) used for detection, the minimum glimpse size, and the use of information in the masked regions. Recognition results were compared with behavioral data. A quantitative analysis demonstrated that the proportion of the time-frequency plane glimpsed is a good predictor of intelligibility. Recognition scores in each noise condition confirmed that sufficient information exists in glimpses to support consonant identification. Close fits to listeners' performance were obtained at two local SNR thresholds: one at around 8 dB and another in the range -5 to -2 dB. A transmitted information analysis revealed that cues to voicing are degraded more in the model than in human auditory processing.},

abstract = {Spatial separation of speech and noise in an anechoic space creates a release from masking that often improves speech intelligibility. However, the masking release is severely reduced in reverberant spaces. This study investigated whether the distinct and separate localization of speech and interference provides any perceptual advantage that, due to the precedence effect, is not degraded by reflections. Listeners' identification of nonsense sentences spoken by a female talker was measured in the presence of either speech-spectrum noise or other sentences spoken by a second female talker. Target and interference stimuli were presented in an anechoic chamber from loudspeakers directly in front and 60 degrees to the right in single-source and precedence-effect (lead-lag) conditions. For speech-spectrum noise, the spatial separation advantage for speech recognition (8 dB) was predictable from articulation index computations based on measured release from masking for narrow-band stimuli. The spatial separation advantage was only 1 dB in the lead-lag condition, despite the fact that a large perceptual separation was produced by the precedence effect. For the female talker interference, a much larger advantage occurred, apparently because informational masking was reduced by differences in perceived locations of target and interference.},

abstract = {APD is a common, heterogeneous and poorly understood listening impairment that is receiving increasing recognition, especially in children and the elderly. The primary symptom in humans is poor speech perception despite normal pure tone audiometry. Diagnostic practice is patchy, but current proposals are to distinguish APD by reduced ability to detect, discriminate, localize and order non-speech sounds. APD appears to result predominantly from core malfunctioning of the central auditory system, but with strong cognitive influences and possible additional influences from peripheral auditory and crossmodal sources. APD may be acquired (e.g. through middle ear disease), but it is likely that a more common etiology would involve both environmental and inherited contributions. Mice are increasingly being used for studies of central auditory processing. Most work to date has documented the basic response properties of auditory neurons, or used single gene mutations to investigate specific functions. For high throughput, primary screening, reflex and/or event-related potential measures are required. Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), the regulation of an acoustic startle reflex by a preceding sound having distinct spatial, temporal or spectral properties, is one way in which auditory processing may be screened. For secondary assessment, standard psychoacoustic tests for mice have been developed.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:A hallmark listening problem of individuals presenting with auditory processing disorder (APD) is their poor recognition of speech in noise. The underlying perceptual problem of the listening difficulties in unfavorable listening conditions is unknown. The objective of this article was to demonstrate theoretically how to determine whether the speech recognition problems are related to an auditory dysfunction, a language-based dysfunction, or a combination of both.

METHOD:Tests such as the Speech Perception in Noise (SPIN) test allow the exploration of the auditory and language-based functions involved in speech perception in noise, which is not possible with most other speech-in-noise tests. Psychometric functions illustrating results from hypothetical groups of individuals with APD on the SPIN test are presented. This approach makes it possible to postulate about the origin of the speech perception problems in noise.

CONCLUSION:APD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder for which the underlying deficit is currently unclear. Because of their design, SPIN-like tests can potentially be used to identify the nature of the deficits underlying problems with speech perception in noise for this population. A better understanding of the difficulties with speech perception in noise experienced by many listeners with APD should lead to more efficient intervention programs.},

abstract = {The conditions of everyday life are such that people often hear speech that has been degraded (e.g., by background noise or electronic transmission) or when they are distracted by other tasks. However, it remains unclear what role attention plays in processing speech that is difficult to understand. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which spoken sentences were processed under distraction, and whether this depended on the acoustic quality (intelligibility) of the speech. On every trial, adult human participants attended to one of three simultaneously presented stimuli: a sentence (at one of four acoustic clarity levels), an auditory distracter, or a visual distracter. A postscan recognition test showed that clear speech was processed even when not attended, but that attention greatly enhanced the processing of degraded speech. Furthermore, speech-sensitive cortex could be parcellated according to how speech-evoked responses were modulated by attention. Responses in auditory cortex and areas along the superior temporal sulcus (STS) took the same form regardless of attention, although responses to distorted speech in portions of both posterior and anterior STS were enhanced under directed attention. In contrast, frontal regions, including left inferior frontal gyrus, were only engaged when listeners were attending to speech and these regions exhibited elevated responses to degraded, compared with clear, speech. We suggest this response is a neural marker of effortful listening. Together, our results suggest that attention enhances the processing of degraded speech by engaging higher-order mechanisms that modulate perceptual auditory processing.},

abstract = {Many species of echolocating bats emit intense orientation sounds. If such intense sounds directly stimulated their ears, detection of faint echoes would be impaired. Therefore, possible mechanisms for the attenuation of self-stimulation were studied with Myotis lucifugus. The acoustic middle-ear-muscle reflex could perfectly and transiently regulate the amplitude of an incoming signal only at its beginning. However, its shortest latency in terms of electromyograms and of the attenuation of the cochlear microphonic was 3-4 and 4-8 msec, respectively, so that these muscles failed to attenuate orientation signals by the reflex. The muscles, however, received a message from the vocalization system when the bat vocalized, and contracted synchronously with vocalization. The duration of the contraction-relaxation was so short that the self-stimulation was attenuated, but the echoes were not. The tetanus-fusion frequency of tha stapedium muscle ranged between 260 and 320/sec. Unlike the efferent fibres in the lateral-line and vestibular systems, the olivo-cochlear bundle showed no sign of attenuation of self-stimulation.},

abstract = {The detection of binaural interaction is of diagnostic interest in patients with central auditory processing disorders (CAPDs), as binaural hearing tasks are frequently affected in these patients. Owing to the comorbidity associated with disorders such as an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, pathological results in subjective tests often show extra-auditory factors such as reduced attention rather than impaired central auditory function. Therefore, objective measures for auditory processing disorders are essential. The binaural interaction component (BIC), which is the arithmetical difference between the sum of the monaurally evoked auditory potentials of each ear and the binaurally evoked brainstem potentials, has been used as an objective measure of binaural interaction in humans. BIC measurements can therefore be considered as a possible diagnostic tool in CAPD patients. One aim of the present study was to examine whether and to what extent BIC measurements are capable of differentiating between normal children and children 'at risk for CAPD'. BIC measurements were performed on 17 children at risk for CAPD and in a group of 25 children with normal results in the central audiometric tests used. Using the presence or absence of clearly demonstrable BIC waveforms as an indication of whether a CAPD is present or not, a sensitivity and specificity of 76% could be achieved. We conclude that BIC measurements might be of some diagnostic value in CAPD patients.},

The electrical activity of single auditory-nerve fibers in response to speech-like sounds (single and two formant synthetic stimuli and "fricative" noise bursts) was recorded with microelectrodes in anesthetized cats. Results demonstrate that a conceptualization of some basic properties of responses to simple acoustic stimuli is useful in interpreting qualitatively how certain characteristics of speech-like sounds can be coded. Specific examples are given for (1) the rapid changes in amplitude and spectrum that occur for each syllable, (2) the fundamental frequency of voiced sounds, and (3) the spectral envelope of fricative consonants. It is also shown that the presence of background noise can have qualitatively different effects on how various characteristics of speech-like sounds are represented.},

abstract = {Introducing simple stimulus regularities facilitates learning of both simple and complex tasks. This facilitation may reflect an implicit change in the strategies used to solve the task when successful predictions regarding incoming stimuli can be formed. We studied the modifications in brain activity associated with fast perceptual learning based on regularity detection. We administered a two-tone frequency discrimination task and measured brain activation (fMRI) under two conditions: with and without a repeated reference tone. Although participants could not explicitly tell the difference between these two conditions, the introduced regularity affected both performance and the pattern of brain activation. The "No-Reference" condition induced a larger activation in frontoparietal areas known to be part of the working memory network. However, only the condition with a reference showed fast learning, which was accompanied by a reduction of activity in two regions: the left intraparietal area, involved in stimulus retention, and the posterior superior-temporal area, involved in representing auditory regularities. We propose that this joint reduction reflects a reduction in the need for online storage of the compared tones. We further suggest that this change reflects an implicit strategic shift "backwards" from reliance mainly on working memory networks in the "No-Reference" condition to increased reliance on detected regularities stored in high-level auditory networks.},

Res. 75, 11-26) from a young patient (S.B.) who had undergone a vestibular neurotomy, during which the olivocochlear bundle (OCB) was severed. Those data are complemented by measurements on 15 other patients-some like S.B. with normal audiometric thresholds, none with a loss greater than 35 dB at experimental frequencies. Comparisons of performance for the same ear before and after surgery or between the operated and healthy ears do not provide evidence that the lack of OCB input impairs the following psychoacoustical functions: (1) detection of tonal signals, (2) intensity discrimination, (3) frequency selectivity, (4) loudness adaptation, (5) frequency discrimination within a tonal series, (6) in-head lateralization. Data on single-tone frequency discrimination are equivocal. These mostly negative results apply to listening both in the quiet and, where relevant, in noise. The only clear change in hearing after a vestibular neurotomy is that most patients detect signals at unexpected frequencies better than before. This change suggests an impaired ability to focus attention in the frequency domain. Although limited in scope, our finding that human hearing without OCB input is essentially normal agrees with much of the relevant literature on animal behavior and with the patients' self-reports.},

abstract = {We live in a complex and dynamically changing acoustic environment. To this end, the auditory cortex of humans has developed the ability to process a remarkable amount of diverse acoustic information with apparent ease. In fact, a phylogenetic comparison of auditory systems reveals that human auditory association cortex in particular has undergone extensive changes relative to that of other species, although our knowledge of this remains incomplete. In contrast to other senses, human auditory cortex receives input that is highly pre-processed in a number of sub-cortical structures; this suggests that even primary auditory cortex already performs quite complex analyses. At the same time, much of the functional role of the various sub-areas in human auditory cortex is still relatively unknown, and a more sophisticated understanding is only now emerging through the use of contemporary electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. The integration of results across the various techniques signify a new era in our knowledge of how human auditory cortex forms basis for auditory experience. This volume on human auditory cortex will have two major parts. In Part A, the principal methodologies currently used to investigate human auditory cortex will be discussed. Each chapter will first outline how the methodology is used in auditory neuroscience, highlighting the challenges of obtaining data from human auditory cortex; second, each methods chapter will provide two or (at most) three brief examples of how it has been used to generate a major result about auditory processing. In Part B, the central questions for auditory processing in human auditory cortex are covered. Each chapter can draw on all the methods introduced in Part A but will focus on a major computational challenge the system has to solve. This volume will constitute an important contemporary reference work on human auditory cortex. Arguably, this will be the first and most focused book on this critical neurological structure. The combination of different methodological and experimental approaches as well as a diverse range of aspects of human auditory perception ensures that this volume will inspire novel insights and spurn future research.},

abstract = {Sound presented to the contralateral ear suppresses the amplitude of the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR). The frequency characteristics of this suppression of the 40-Hz ASSR for amplitude modulated (AM) tones at 1,000 Hz (79-dB SPL) were examined in 12 healthy volunteers (10 males and 2 females, mean age 32.3 years) using contralateral AM tones (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz) and 1/3 octave-band noise (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz). The 40-Hz ASSR at 1,000 Hz was suppressed by a relatively wide frequency range of contralateral sound than expected from the known characteristics of psychophysical central masking by contralateral sound: the greatest suppression was obtained with 500- and 1,000-Hz sounds, but considerable suppression was also obtained with 2,000- and 4,000-Hz sounds. Substantial differences in the suppression pattern were not observed between two types of contra-suppressors; i.e., AM tones and 1/3 octave-band noise. Therefore, any sound presented to the contralateral ear, regardless of the frequency, can suppress the 40-Hz ASSR. Moreover, the different frequency characteristics of the contralateral sound effects between the psychophysical central masking and the 40-Hz ASSR would support the idea that the 40-Hz ASSR has an additive role in the processing of auditory signals to simple threshold judgment. Investigation of the type of psychophysical measurement using the AM signal showing similar suppression patterns by the presentation of contralateral sound would be helpful to reveal the functional relevance of ASSRs.},

abstract = {Hearing and communication present a variety of challenges to the nervous system. To be heard and understood, a communication signal must be transformed from a time-varying acoustic waveform to a perceptual representation to an even more abstract representation that integrates memory stores with semantic/referential information. Finally, this complex, abstract representation must be interpreted to form categorical decisions that guide behavior. Did I hear the stimulus? From where and whom did it come? What does it tell me? How can I use this information to plan an action? All of these issues and questions underlie auditory cognition. Since the early 1990s, there has been a re-birth of studies that test the neural correlates of auditory cognition with a unique emphasis on the use of awake, behaving animals as model. Continuing today, how and where in the brain neural correlates of auditory cognition are formed is an intensive and active area of research. Importantly, our understanding of the role that the cortex plays in hearing has the potential to impact the next generation of cochlear- and brainstem-auditory implants and consequently help those with hearing impairments. Thus, it is timely to produce a volume that brings together this exciting literature on the neural correlates of auditory cognition. This volume compliments and extends many recent SHAR volumes such as Sound Source Localization (2005) Auditory Perception of Sound Sources (2007), and Human Auditory Cortex (2010). For example, in many of these volumes, similar issues are discussed such as auditory-object identification and perception with different emphases: in Auditory Perception of Sound Sources, authors discuss the underlying psychophysics/behavior, whereas in the Human Auditory Cortex, fMRI data are presented. The unique contribution of the proposed volume is that the authors will integrate both of these factors to highlight the neural correlates of cognition/behavior. Moreover, unlike other these other volumes, the neurophysiological data will emphasize the exquisite spatial and temporal resolution of single-neuron [as opposed to more coarse fMRI or MEG data] responses in order to reveal the elegant representations and computations used by the nervous system.},

abstract = {Many competing noises in real environments are modulated or fluctuating in level. Listeners with normal hearing are able to take advantage of temporal gaps in fluctuating maskers. Listeners with sensorineural hearing loss show less benefit from modulated maskers. Cochlear implant users may be more adversely affected by modulated maskers because of their limited spectral resolution and by their reliance on envelope-based signal-processing strategies of implant processors. The current study evaluated cochlear implant users' ability to understand sentences in the presence of modulated speech-shaped noise. Normal-hearing listeners served as a comparison group. Listeners repeated IEEE sentences in quiet, steady noise, and modulated noise maskers. Maskers were presented at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at six modulation rates varying from 1 to 32 Hz. Results suggested that normal-hearing listeners obtain significant release from masking from modulated maskers, especially at 8-Hz masker modulation frequency. In contrast, cochlear implant users experience very little release from masking from modulated maskers. The data suggest, in fact, that they may show negative effects of modulated maskers at syllabic modulation rates (2-4 Hz). Similar patterns of results were obtained from implant listeners using three different devices with different speech-processor strategies. The lack of release from masking occurs in implant listeners independent of their device characteristics, and may be attributable to the nature of implant processing strategies and/or the lack of spectral detail in processed stimuli.},

Twelve vowels were synthesized using two different synthesis methods, one where the original spectral detail was preserved, and one where the vowel was represented by the spectral peaks of the first three formants. In addition, formants F1 and F2 were suppressed individually to investigate the importance of each in severe noise. Vowels were presented to listeners in quiet and in speech-shaped noise at signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of 0, -5, and -10 dB, and vowel confusions were determined in a number of conditions. Results suggest that the auditory system relies on formant information for vowel perception irrespective of the SNR, but that, as noise increases, it relies increasingly on more complete spectral information to perform formant extraction. A second finding was that, while F2 is more important in quiet or low noise conditions, F1 and F2 are of similar importance in severe noise.},

abstract = {Steady-state responses can follow multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli. If the stimuli are modulated at different rates, responses specific to each stimulus can be assessed by measuring in the frequency domain response the spectral component corresponding to the rate of modulation. When each stimulus has a different carrier frequency or different ear of presentation, the responses when 8 stimuli are presented simultaneously are not significantly different than when each stimulus is presented alone. Since significant responses can be recognized down to intensities that average 14 dB above behavioral threshold, this technique may be useful in objective audiometry. It is also possible to record steady-state responses to multiple modulations of the same carrier frequency. In this case, the amplitude of the responses when the stimuli are combined is smaller than when the stimuli are presented alone. The decrease in amplitude depends upon the number of concomitant stimuli and their relative intensities. These effects are probably due to the compressive rectification occurring during cochlear transduction, and the data may be used to model cochlear processing of auditory stimuli.},

abstract = {Detection and localization of a target sound in the presence of concurrent, spatially distributed masking sounds is one of the most challenging tasks for the mammalian auditory system. Previous studies demonstrated that the ability to localize signals is decreased by interfering noise. In order to directly compare the behavioral performance in a signal processing task in noise between gerbils and humans in the free sound field, we quantified their localization ability for a low-frequency signal in the presence of six masking noise sources surrounding the subject. Thresholds were measured both for masking noises that were correlated or uncorrelated across the masking sources. Overall, the gerbils required a higher signal/noise ratio to detect the low-frequency signal than the humans; that is, the behavioral performance of the gerbils was considerably worse than that of the humans. Moreover, switching from maskers that were uncorrelated across the masking sources to correlated maskers resulted in more masking in gerbils but in a release from masking in humans. These results would suggest that the gerbil may not be a good animal model for binaural processing. However, simulations of the localization thresholds in a numerical model of binaural processing in gerbils and humans reveal that both the inferior overall performance in gerbils and the opposite effect of masker correlation on the detection thresholds can be attributed to the smaller head size and the wider peripheral auditory filters in gerbils. Thus, the current data indicate that the binaural processor itself (i.e., the evaluation of signals coming from the two ears) is equally sensitive in gerbils and humans. However, the physical limitations imposed by the small head prevent the gerbil from performing equally well in the current paradigm.},

abstract = {A class of cochlear models which account for much of the characteristic variation with frequency of human otoacoustic emissions and hearing threshold microstructure is presented. The models are based upon wave reflections via distributed spatial cochlear inhomogeneities and tall and broad cochlear activity patterns, as suggested by Zweig and Shera [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 98, 2018-2047 (1995)]. They successfully describe in particular the following features: (1) the characteristic quasiperiodic frequency variations (fine structures) of the hearing threshold, synchronous and click-evoked emissions, distortion-product emissions, and spontaneous emissions; (2) the relationships between these fine structures; and (3) the distortion product emission filter shape. All of the characteristic frequency spacings are approximately the same (0.4 bark) and are mainly determined by the phase behavior of the apical reflection function. The frequency spacings for spontaneous emissions and threshold microstructure are predicted to be the same, but some deviations from these values are predicted for synchronous and click-evoked and distortion-product emissions. The analysis of models is aided considerably by the use of the solutions of apical, and basal, moving solutions (basis functions) of the cochlear wave equation in the absence of inhomogeneities.},

At near-threshold stimulus levels, the frequency tuning of auditory nerve fibers closely paralleled that of basilar membrane displacement modified by high-pass filtering, indicating that only relatively minor signal transformations intervene between mechanical vibration and auditory nerve excitation. This finding establishes that cochlear frequency selectivity in chinchillas (and probably in mammals in general) is fully expressed in the vibrations of the basilar membrane and renders unnecessary additional ("second") filters, such as those present in the hair cells of the cochleae of reptiles.},

abstract = {Time-domain filtering is a standard analysis technique, which is used to disentangle the two main vector components of the distortion product otoacoustic emission response, exploiting their different phase-frequency relation. In this study, a time-frequency filtering technique based on the continuous wavelet transform is proposed to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the time-domain filtering technique and to extend it also to the analysis of stimulus-frequency and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. The advantages of the proposed technique are first discussed on a theoretical basis, then practically demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of synthesized and real otoacoustic data. The results show that the time-frequency approach can be empirically optimized to get effective separation of the components of the otoacoustic response associated with either different generation mechanisms or different generation places. Focusing on a single component of the otoacoustic response with a given time-frequency signature may also improve significantly the signal-to-noise ratio, because the random noise contribution tends to be uniformly distributed on the time-frequency plane.},

This was done in four background conditions: in silence, and in three types of noise (S/N=+10 dB) varying in temporal structure and meaningfulness. Four groups of 12 subjects each (young/elderly with normal hearing and young/elderly with hearing impairment) participated. The presence of noise had a negative effect on accuracy and speed of performance in the speech processing tasks, and resulted in higher scores of perceived effort, even when the stimuli were presented as text. Differences in performance between noise conditions existed. In the subjective scores, the noise with temporal variations, but without meaningful content, was the most disruptive of the three noise conditions. In the objective scores the hearing-impaired subjects showed poorer results in noise with temporal variations. The elderly subjects were more distracted by noise with temporal variations, and especially by noise with meaningful content. In noise, all subjects, particularly those with impaired hearing, were more dependent upon visual cues than in the quiet condition.},

abstract = {The ability to determine the location of a sound source is fundamental to hearing. However, auditory space is not represented in any systematic manner on the basilar membrane of the cochlea, the sensory surface of the receptor organ for hearing. Understanding the means by which sensitivity to spatial cues is computed in central neurons can therefore contribute to our understanding of the basic nature of complex neural representations. We review recent evidence concerning the nature of the neural representation of auditory space in the mammalian brain and elaborate on recent advances in the understanding of mammalian subcortical processing of auditory spatial cues that challenge the "textbook" version of sound localization, in particular brain mechanisms contributing to binaural hearing.},

abstract = {Reflection-source otoacoustic emission phase-gradient delays are widely used to obtain noninvasive estimates of cochlear function and properties, such as the sharpness of mechanical tuning and its variation along the length of the cochlear partition. Although different data-processing strategies are known to yield different delay estimates and trends, their relative reliability has not been established. This paper uses in silico experiments to evaluate six methods for extracting delay trends from reflection-source otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). The six methods include both previously published procedures (e.g., phase smoothing, energy-weighting, data exclusion based on signal-to-noise ratio) and novel strategies (e.g., peak-picking, all-pass factorization). Although some of the methods perform well (e.g., peak-picking), others introduce substantial bias (e.g., phase smoothing) and are not recommended. In addition, since standing waves caused by multiple internal reflection can complicate the interpretation and compromise the application of OAE delays, this paper develops and evaluates two promising signal-processing strategies, the first based on time-frequency filtering using the continuous wavelet transform and the second on cepstral analysis, for separating the direct emission from its subsequent reflections. Altogether, the results help to resolve previous disagreements about the frequency dependence of human OAE delays and the sharpness of cochlear tuning while providing useful analysis methods for future studies.},

abstract = {Sound envelope temporal fluctuations are important for effective processing of biologically relevant acoustic information including speech, animal vocalizations, sound-source location, and pitch. Amplitude modulation (AM) of sound envelopes can be encoded in quiet with high fidelity by many auditory neurons including those of the auditory nerve (AN) and cochlear nucleus. From both neurophysiological and clinical perspectives, it is critical to understand the effects of background masking noise on the processing of AM. To further this goal, single-unit recordings were made from AN fibers in anesthetized chinchillas. Units were classified according to spontaneous firing rate (SR) and threshold. Best frequency (BF) pure-tone bursts and AM (10-500 Hz) tone bursts were employed as stimuli at several sound levels, both in quiet and in the presence of a continuous wideband noise. It was found that (1) in quiet, low SR AN fibers show the strongest AM coding, followed in order by medium SR and high SR fibers, respectively. (2) AN units of all three classes generally preserve their AM coding even in the presence of loud (0 or +6 dB S/N) background noise and at high sound levels (over 75 dB SPL). (3) This preservation is usually achieved by lowering the average firing rate proportionately to decreases in the synchronous (fundamental frequency) response. (4) For a few AN fibers, the AM coding increases or is reduced in the presence of the background noise. These findings suggest that AN preservation of AM coding in the presence of a continuous masking noise results from shifts in the operating ranges and firing rates of AN fibers resulting from cochlear nonlinearities and adaptive mechanisms.},

abstract = {This response to A. T. Cacace and D. J. McFarland (2005) identifies points of agreement and disagreement regarding the concept of modularity in the diagnosis of (central) auditory processing disorder [(C)APD]. We concur that the evaluation of (C)APD must take into consideration the influence of higher order global or pansensory issues on performance on tests of central auditory function. To accomplish this goal, multidisciplinary (e.g., multimodal) testing is an integral part of differential diagnosis of (C)APD. We also agree that the efficiency of diagnostic tests of (C)APD should not be evaluated by imprecise criteria [e.g., "presumed" or "suspected" (C)APD], which do not provide accurate measures of the true sensitivity and specificity of these tests. Our conceptualization and recommendations for clinical practice in this area diverge, however, from that of Cacace and McFarland in a number of pivotal ways. Based on the current limitations of multimodal assessment relative to issues related to scope of practice and test efficiency, as well as the accumulated basic science and clinical literature that demonstrates the nonmodularity and interactive organization of the brain, we recommend use of the sensitized test battery of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) in combination with multidisciplinary testing to differentially diagnose (C)APD and to guide treatment of the disorder. We assert that sensitivity and specificity measures derived from individuals with well-circumscribed lesions of the CANS provide an important guide to establishing the validity of central auditory diagnostic tests. We note that researchers in the area of auditory science and (C)APD must acknowledge the challenges of the clinical arena, and we encourage their continued help to develop diagnostic tools that are both efficient and practical for the differential diagnosis of (C)APD. We conclude that our approach, which combines multidisciplinary evaluation and specific tests of central auditory function that have demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for disorders of the CANS, allows us to identify (and thus rehabilitate) the auditory deficits present in individuals with (C)APD in its "purest" form. It also permits the identification and rehabilitation of auditory deficits in individuals who exhibit auditory perceptual problems that coexist with other processing problems, while ruling out those who perform poorly on auditory tests because of a global, supramodal problem involving cognition, attention, language, memory, or related skills.},

Here we review such experience-driven map development and plasticity, focusing on the auditory system, and giving particular consideration to its adaptive value and to the putative mechanisms involved. Recent data have challenged the widely held notion that only the developing auditory brain can be influenced by changes to the prevailing acoustic environment, unless those changes convey information of behavioral relevance. Specifically, it has been shown that persistent exposure of adult animals to random, bandlimited, moderately loud sounds can lead to a reorganization of auditory cortex not unlike that following restricted hearing loss. The mature auditory brain is thus more plastic than previously supposed, with potentially troubling consequences for those working or living in noisy environments, even at exposure levels considerably below those presently considered just-acceptable.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To measure sound source localization in children who have sequential bilateral cochlear implants (BICIs); to determine whether localization accuracy correlates with performance on a right-left discrimination task (i.e., spatial acuity); to determine whether there is a measurable bilateral benefit on a sound source identification task (i.e., localization accuracy) by comparing performance under bilateral and unilateral listening conditions; and to determine whether sound source localization continues to improve with longer durations of bilateral experience.

DESIGN:Two groups of children participated in this study: a group of 21 children who received BICIs in sequential procedures (5 to 14 years) and a group of 7 typically developing children with normal acoustic hearing (5 years). Testing was conducted in a large sound-treated booth with loudspeakers positioned on a horizontal arc with a radius of 1.2 m. Children participated in two experiments that assessed spatial hearing skills. Spatial hearing acuity was assessed with a discrimination task in which listeners determined whether a sound source was presented on the right or left side of center; the smallest angle at which performance on this task was reliably above chance is the minimum audible angle. Sound localization accuracy was assessed with a sound source identification task in which children identified the perceived position of the sound source from a multiloudspeaker array (7 or 15); errors are quantified using the root mean square (RMS) error.

RESULTS:Sound localization accuracy was highly variable among the children with BICIs, with RMS errors ranging from 19 to 56 degrees . Performance of the normal hearing group, with RMS errors ranging from 9 to 29 degrees was significantly better. Within the BICI group, in 11 of 21 children, RMS errors were smaller in the bilateral versus unilateral listening condition, indicating bilateral benefit. There was a significant correlation between spatial acuity and sound localization accuracy (R = 0.68, p < 0.01), suggesting that children who achieve small RMS errors tend to have the smallest minimum audible angles. Although there was large intersubject variability, testing of 11 children in the BICI group at two sequential visits revealed a subset of children who show improvement in spatial hearing skills over time.

CONCLUSIONS:A subset of children who use sequential BICIs can acquire sound localization abilities, even after long intervals between activation of hearing in the first- and second-implanted ears. This suggests that children with activation of the second implant later in life may be capable of developing spatial hearing abilities. The large variability in performance among the children with BICIs suggests that maturation of sound localization abilities in children with BICIs may be dependent on various individual subject factors such as age of implantation and chronological age.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The medial olivocochlear (MOC) pathway modulates basilar membrane motion and auditory nerve activity on both a fast (10-100 ms) and a slow (10-100 s) time scale in guinea pigs. The slow MOC modulation of cochlear activity is postulated to aide in protection against acoustic trauma. However in humans, the existence and functional roles of slow MOC effects remain unexplored.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:By employing contralateral noise at moderate to high levels (68 and 83 dB SPL) as an MOC reflex elicitor, and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) as a non-invasive probe of the cochlea, we demonstrated MOC modulation of human cochlear output both on a fast and a slow time scale, analogous to the fast and slow MOC efferent effects observed on basilar membrane vibration and auditory nerve activity in guinea pigs. The magnitude of slow effects was minimal compared with that of fast effects. Consistent with basilar membrane and auditory nerve activity data, SOAE level was reduced by both fast and slow MOC effects, whereas SOAE frequency was elevated by fast and reduced by slow MOC effects. The magnitudes of fast and slow effects on SOAE level were positively correlated.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Contralateral noise up to 83 dB SPL elicited minimal yet significant changes in both SOAE level and frequency on a slow time scale, consistent with a high threshold or small magnitude of slow MOC effects in humans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:Children with auditory processing disorder (APD) typically present with "listening difficulties,"' including problems understanding speech in noisy environments. The authors examined, in a group of such children, whether a 12-week computer-based auditory training programme with speech material improved the perception of speech-in-noise test performance, and functional listening skills as assessed by parental and teacher listening and communication questionnaires. The authors hypothesized that after the intervention, (1) trained children would show greater improvements in speech-in-noise perception than untrained controls; (2) this improvement would correlate with improvements in observer-rated behaviors; and (3) the improvement would be maintained for at least 3 months after the end of training.

DESIGN:This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of 39 children with normal nonverbal intelligence, ages 7 to 11 years, all diagnosed with APD. This diagnosis required a normal pure-tone audiogram and deficits in at least two clinical auditory processing tests. The APD children were randomly assigned to (1) a control group that received only the current standard treatment for children diagnosed with APD, employing various listening/educational strategies at school (N = 19); or (2) an intervention group that undertook a 3-month 5-day/week computer-based auditory training programme at home, consisting of a wide variety of speech-based listening tasks with competing sounds, in addition to the current standard treatment. All 39 children were assessed for language and cognitive skills at baseline and on three outcome measures at baseline and immediate postintervention. Outcome measures were repeated 3 months postintervention in the intervention group only, to assess the sustainability of treatment effects. The outcome measures were (1) the mean speech reception threshold obtained from the four subtests of the listening in specialized noise test that assesses sentence perception in various configurations of masking speech, and in which the target speakers and test materials were unrelated to the training materials; (2) the Children's Auditory Performance Scale that assesses listening skills, completed by the children's teachers; and (3) the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamental-4 pragmatic profile that assesses pragmatic language use, completed by parents.

RESULTS:All outcome measures significantly improved at immediate postintervention in the intervention group only, with effect sizes ranging from 0.76 to 1.7. Improvements in speech-in-noise performance correlated with improved scores in the Children's Auditory Performance Scale questionnaire in the trained group only. Baseline language and cognitive assessments did not predict better training outcome. Improvements in speech-in-noise performance were sustained 3 months postintervention.

CONCLUSIONS:Broad speech-based auditory training led to improved auditory processing skills as reflected in speech-in-noise test performance and in better functional listening in real life. The observed correlation between improved functional listening with improved speech-in-noise perception in the trained group suggests that improved listening was a direct generalization of the auditory training.},

abstract = {We employed cholera toxin-B (CTB), an efficient retrograde tracer, to examine olivocochlear (OC) neurons in the cat. Our primary goals were (1). to determine whether the cat has two types of lateral OC (LOC) neurons as is found in certain rodents and (2). to document the morphology, number, and caudorostral distribution of OC neurons, bilaterally. Adult cats received injections of CTB through the round window of the left cochlea, and, after 3-6 days, the brains were sectioned transversely and CTB was revealed immunocytochemically in every section. In three cats, OC neurons were mapped, counted differentially according to cell group, and the numbers of each plotted bilaterally from caudal to rostral. In one cat, measurements were made on labeled LOC and medial OC (MOC) neurons. The results indicate that LOC neurons can be divided into two groups based on their proximity to the lateral superior olive (LSO): a more populous group of small neurons that have intimate contact with the LSO, designated marginal-LOC neurons, and a less populous, morphologically heterogeneous group, lying more distantly from the LSO, designated para-LOC neurons. Para-LOC neurons lying dorsal and rostral to LSO were significantly larger than marginal-LOC. We hypothesize that the cat marginal-LOC neurons and most probably the larger para-LOC neurons correspond to rodent intrinsic and shell LOC neurons, respectively, which have focal versus diffuse projections beneath the inner hair cells. Concerning MOC neurons, we confirm and extend previous observations on the clustering of these neurons near the rostral tip of the medial superior olivary nucleus and also show that MOC neurons differ in size according to cell group. Finally, we compare the present counts of OC neurons (mean total 1607, consisting of 1058 LOC neurons and 549 MOC neurons innervating one cochlea) and their proportional distribution ipsilaterally and contralaterally with those reported previously. Our estimate of the number of LOC neurons is somewhat higher than those previously obtained either by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase or by counting unmyelinated axons in the olivocochlear bundle. In contrast, our estimate of the number of MOC neurons is very similar to those previously reported.},

abstract = {To date, the functional and physiological impact on the mature brain of moderate-level environmental noises that do not cause noticeable peripheral deficits remains largely unstudied. Here we show that exposing adult rats to structured noise at a sound pressure level of 65 dB, which is markedly below the broadly accepted safety level standard, results in behavioural impairments and substantially impairs the function of the auditory cortex. The strong deterioration in cortical processing of acoustic inputs is independent of the modulation rates of structured noises. Almost equally strong effects result from 10-h daily versus 24-h daily exposure regimens. These results indicate that there can be substantial negative consequences for the auditory system documented at the cortical level, attributable to environmental exposure to structured noises delivered under conditions that do not directly impact hearing sensitivity. These noises are deemed to be 'safe' and are often present in modern human environments.},

abstract = {The adaptive properties of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 2f(1)-f2 were investigated in 12 ears of normally hearing adults aged 18-30 years using long-lasting 1-s primary-tone on-times. In this manner, DPOAE adaptation at a single f2 of 1.55 kHz (f2/f1=1.21) was evaluated as a function of the levels of the primary tones in a matrix of L1, L2 settings, which varied from 45 to 80 dB SPL, in 5-dB steps. DPOAEs were elicited under both monaural and binaural stimulus-presentation conditions. Adaptation was defined as the difference in DPOAE levels between the initial 92-ms baseline measure using a standard protocol and one obtained during the final 92 ms of the prolonged 1-s primary-tones. These differences were averaged across subjects to create contour plots of mean adaptation in the L1,L2 space. The 2f(1)-f2 DPOAE revealed consistent regions of suppression (-0.5 dB difference) or enhancement (+0.5 dB difference) with respect to baseline measures within the L(1),L(2) matrix for both acoustic-stimulation conditions. Specifically, 2f(1)-f2 DPOAE suppressions of 1-2 dB occurred for both monaural and binaural presentations, typically at level combinations in which L1>L2. In contrast, larger 2f(1)-f2 DPOAE enhancements of 3-4 dB occurred for only the binaural condition, at primary-tone level combinations where L1<L2. Although adaptation activity was also evaluated for the DPOAEs at f(2)-f1, 2f(2)-f1, and 3f(1)-2f2, these emissions were either immeasurable (e.g., f(2)-f1) or only present in a subset of subjects over a narrow range of primary-tone frequencies and levels that did not support a systematic analysis. In summary, the 2f(1)-f2 results suggest that a potentially important area for adaptation measures exists in the L1,L2 space, when L1 is lower than L2. This combination of primary-tone levels can lead to large DPOAE adaptation effects that may be related to a notch in the DPOAE response/growth or input/output (I/O) function.},

abstract = {Spatial release from masking was studied in a three-talker soundfield listening experiment. The target talker was presented at 0 degrees azimuth and the maskers were either colocated or symmetrically positioned around the target, with a different masker talker on each side. The symmetric placement greatly reduced any "better ear" listening advantage. When the maskers were separated from the target by +/-15 degrees , the average spatial release from masking was 8 dB. Wider separations increased the release to more than 12 dB. This large effect was eliminated when binaural cues and perceived spatial separation were degraded by covering one ear with an earplug and earmuff. Increasing reverberation in the room increased the target-to-masker ratio (TM) for the separated, but not colocated, conditions reducing the release from masking, although a significant advantage of spatial separation remained. Time reversing the masker speech improved performance in both the colocated and spatially separated cases but lowered TM the most for the colocated condition, also resulting in a reduction in the spatial release from masking. Overall, the spatial tuning observed appears to depend on the presence of interaural differences that improve the perceptual segregation of sources and facilitate the focus of attention at a point in space.},

abstract = {Consonant identification was measured for normal-hearing listeners using Vowel-Consonant-Vowel stimuli that were either unprocessed or spectrally degraded to force listeners to use temporal-envelope cues. Stimuli were embedded in a steady state or fluctuating noise masker and presented at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio. Fluctuations in the maskers were obtained by applying sinusoidal modulation to: (i) the amplitude of the noise (1st-order SAM masker) or (ii) the modulation depth of a 1st-order SAM noise (2nd-order SAM masker). The frequencies of the amplitude variation fm and the depth variation f'm were systematically varied. Consistent with previous studies, identification scores obtained with unprocessed speech were highest in an 8-Hz, 1st-order SAM masker. Reception of voicing and manner also peaked around fm=8 Hz, while the reception of place of articulation was maximal at a higher frequency (fm=32 Hz). When 2nd-order SAM maskers were used, identification scores and received information for each consonant feature were found to be independent of f'm. They decreased progressively with increasing carrier modulation frequency fm, and ranged between those obtained with the steady state and the 1st-order SAM maskers. Finally, the results obtained with spectrally degraded speech were similar across all types of maskers, although an 8% improvement in the reception of voicing was observed for modulated maskers with fm < 64 Hz compared to the steady-state masker. These data provide additional evidence that listeners take advantage of temporal minima in fluctuating background noises, and suggest that: (i) minima of different durations are required for an optimal reception of the three consonant features and (ii) complex (i.e., 2nd-order) envelope fluctuations in background noise do not degrade speech identification by interfering with speech-envelope processing.},

abstract = {Binaural hearing improves performance in most auditory tasks and is essential for some. This paper introduces the brain stem pathways and nuclei involved in binaural interaction and outlines some recent approaches to understanding binaural mechanisms. It also provides examples of basic science approaches to the effects of infant hearing loss on those pathways and mechanisms. Binaural interaction occurs primarily and almost simultaneously at three levels of the brain: the superior olivary complex (SOC), the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (NLL) and the inferior colliculus (IC). The SOC derives its input from the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus (CN) through branching axons that innervate several SOC subdivisions on both sides of the brain. At least some of these anteroventral CN axons project on up to the contralateral NLL and IC. The IC and NLL also receive direct, major projections from the contralateral CN, via the dorsal and intermediate acoustic striae, and from the SOC bilaterally. The IC receives additional input from the NLL bilaterally, and is thus innervated by every nuclear group within the auditory brain stem. There is little evidence for strict, functional segregation in these binaural pathways, although subdivisions of the SOC appear to be predominantly involved in analysing either interaural time or level differences (ITD, ILD). ITD- and ILD-sensitive neurones are also found in abundance in the central IC. There is emerging evidence that binaural information is coupled with spectral cues derived from the outer ear in several auditory mid-brain regions [the NLL, the external IC and the superior colliculus (SC)] to produce topographic representations of auditory space. Throughout the higher auditory system the response of neurones to stimulation of each ear is either excitatory or inhibitory, and there is a spatial segregation of neurones receiving predominantly excitatory or inhibitory input from the ipsilateral ear in both the medial geniculate body of the thalamus and the auditory cortex. Neonatal, unilateral hearing loss leads to a rearrangement of binaural connections in the auditory brain stem, to changes in the physiology of IC neurones in response to stimulation of the normal ear and to compensatory alterations in the auditory space map in the SC. The same hearing losses in adulthood do not produce these changes. The evidence from this and other work suggests that binaural mechanisms are more sensitive to hearing loss, over a longer developmental period, than mechanisms subserving monaural processing.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:1) To describe transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) levels, noise levels and signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for a range of frequency bands in three groups of neonates who were tested as a part of the Identification of Neonatal Hearing Impairment multi-center consortium project. 2) To describe the relations between these TEOAE measurements and age, test environment, baby state, and test time.

DESIGN:TEOAEs were measured in 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 353 well babies with at least one risk indicator, and 2348 well babies without risk factors. TEOAE and noise levels were measured for frequency bands centered at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz for a click stimulus level of 80 dB SPL. For those ears not meeting "passing" stopping criteria at 80 dB pSPL, a level of 86 dB pSPL was included. Measurement-based stopping rules were used such that a test did not terminate unless the response revealed a criterion SNR in four out of five frequency bands or no response occurred after a preset number of averages. Baby state, test environment, and other test factors were captured at the time of test.

RESULTS:TEOAE levels, noise levels and SNRs were similar for NICU graduates, well babies with risk factors and well babies without risk factors. There were no consistent differences in response quality as a function of test environment, i.e., private room, unit, open crib, nonworking isolette, or working isolette. Noise level varied little across risk group, test environment, or infant state other than crying, suggesting that the primary source of noise in TEOAE measurements is infant noise. The most significant effect on response quality was center frequency. Responses were difficult to measure in the half-octave band centered at 1.0 kHz, compared with higher frequencies. Reliable responses were measured routinely at frequencies of 1.5 kHz and higher.

CONCLUSIONS:TEOAEs are easily measured in both NICU graduates and well babies with and without risk factors for hearing loss in a wide variety of test environments. Given the difficulties encountered in making reliable measurements for a frequency band centered at 1.0 kHz, its inclusion in a screening program may not be justified.},

abstract = {Suppression of ipsilateral distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) by contralateral noise is used in humans and animals to assay the strength of sound-evoked negative feedback from the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent pathway. However, depending on species and anesthesia, contributions of other feedback systems to the middle or inner ear can cloud the interpretation. Here, contributions of MOC and middle-ear muscle reflexes, as well as autonomic feedback, to contra-noise suppression in anesthetized mice are dissected by selectively eliminating each pathway by surgical transection, pharmacological blockade, or targeted gene deletion. When ipsilateral DPOAEs were evoked by low-level primaries, contra-noise suppression was typically ∼1 dB with contra-noise levels around 95 dB SPL, and it always disappeared upon contralateral cochlear destruction. Lack of middle-ear muscle contribution was suggested by persistence of contra-noise suppression after paralysis with curare, tensor tympani cauterization, or section of the facial nerve. Contribution of cochlear sympathetics was ruled out by studying mutant mice lacking adrenergic signaling (dopamine $\beta$-hydroxylase knockouts). Surprisingly, contra-noise effects on low-level DPOAEs were also not diminished by eliminating the MOC system pharmacologically (strychnine), surgically, or by deletion of relevant cholinergic receptors ($\alpha$9/$\alpha$10). In contrast, when ipsilateral DPOAEs were evoked by high-level primaries, the contra-noise suppression, although comparable in magnitude, was largely eliminated by MOC blockade or section. Possible alternate pathways are discussed for the source of contra-noise-evoked effects at low ipsilateral levels.},

abstract = {The mammalian auditory system includes a brainstem-mediated efferent pathway from the superior olivary complex by way of the medial olivocochlear system, which reduces the cochlear response to sound (Warr and Guinan, 1979; Liberman et al., 1996). The human medial olivocochlear response has an onset delay of between 25 and 40 ms and rise and decay constants in the region of 280 and 160 ms, respectively (Backus and Guinan, 2006). Physiological studies with nonhuman mammals indicate that onset and decay characteristics of efferent activation are dependent on the temporal and level characteristics of the auditory stimulus (Bacon and Smith, 1991; Guinan and Stankovic, 1996). This study uses a novel psychoacoustical masking technique using a precursor sound to obtain a measure of the efferent effect in humans. This technique avoids confounds currently associated with other psychoacoustical measures. Both temporal and level dependency of the efferent effect was measured, providing a comprehensive measure of the effect of human auditory efferents on cochlear gain and compression. Results indicate that a precursor (>20 dB SPL) induced efferent activation, resulting in a decrease in both maximum gain and maximum compression, with linearization of the compressive function for input sound levels between 50 and 70 dB SPL. Estimated gain decreased as precursor level increased, and increased as the silent interval between the precursor and combined masker-signal stimulus increased, consistent with a decay of the efferent effect. Human auditory efferent activation linearizes the cochlear response for mid-level sounds while reducing maximum gain.},

abstract = {Operant conditioning procedures were used to measure the effects of bilateral olivocochlear lesions on the cat's discrimination thresholds for changes in the second formant frequency (deltaF2) of the vowel /epsilon/. Three cats were tested with the formant discrimination task under quiet conditions and in the presence of continuous broadband noise at signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) of 23, 13, and 3 dB. In quiet, vowel levels of 50 and 70 dB produced average deltaF2s of 42 and 47 Hz, respectively, and these thresholds did not change significantly in low levels of background noise (S/Ns = 23 and 13 dB). Average deltaF2s increased to 94 and 97 Hz for vowel levels of 50 and 70 dB in the loudest level of background noise (S/N = 3 dB). Average deltaF2 thresholds in quiet and in lower noise levels were only slightly affected when the olivocochlear bundle was lesioned by making bilateral cuts into the floor of the IVth ventricle. In contrast, post-lesion deltaF2 thresholds in the highest noise level were significantly larger than pre-lesion values; the most severely affected subject showed post-lesion discrimination thresholds well over 200 Hz for both 50 and 70 dB vowels. These results suggest that olivocochlear feedback may enhance speech processing in high levels of ambient noise.},

abstract = {1. The vibratory response to two-tone stimuli was measured in the basilar membrane of the chinchilla cochlea by means of the M{\"o}ssbauer technique or laser velocimetry. Measurements were made at sites with characteristic frequency (CF, the frequency at which an auditory structure is most sensitive) of 7-10 kHz, located approximately 3.5 mm from the oval window. 2. Two-tone suppression (reduction in the response to one tone due to the presence of another) was demonstrated for CF probe tones and suppressor tones with frequencies both higher and lower than CF, at moderately low stimulus levels, including probe-suppressor combinations for which responses to the suppressor were lower than responses to the probe tone alone. 3. For a fixed suppressor tone, suppression magnitude decreased as a function of increasing probe intensity. 4. The magnitude of suppression increased monotonically with suppressor intensity. 5. The rate of growth of suppression magnitude with suppressor intensity was higher for suppressors in the region below CF than for those in the region above CF. 6. For low-frequency suppressor tones, suppression magnitude varied periodically, attaining one or two maxima within each period of the suppressor tone. 7. Suppression was frequency tuned: for either above-CF or below-CF suppressor tones, suppression magnitude reached a maximum for probe frequencies near CF. 8. Cochlear damage or death diminished or abolished suppression. There was a clear positive correlation between magnitude of suppression and basilar-membrane sensitivity for responses to CF tones. 9. Suppression tended to be accompanied by small phase lags in responses to CF probe tones. 10. Because all of the features of two-tone suppression at the basilar membrane match qualitatively (and, generally, also quantitatively) the features of two-tone rate suppression in auditory-nerve fibers, it is concluded that neural two-tone rate suppression originates in mechanical phenomena at the basilar membrane. 11. Because the lability of mechanical suppression parallels the loss of sensitivity and frequency tuning due to outer hair cell dysfunction, the present findings suggest that mechanical two-tone suppression arises from an interaction between the outer hair cells and the basilar membrane.},

abstract = {The operation of the mammalian cochlea relies on a mechanical traveling wave that is actively boosted by electromechanical forces in sensory outer hair cells (OHCs). This active cochlear amplifier produces the impressive sensitivity and frequency resolution of mammalian hearing. The cochlear amplifier has inspired scientists since its discovery in the 1970s, and is still not well understood. To explore cochlear electromechanics at the sensory cell/tissue interface, sound-evoked intracochlear pressure and extracellular voltage were measured using a recently developed dual-sensor with a microelectrode attached to a micro-pressure sensor. The resulting coincident in~vivo observations of OHC electrical activity, pressure at the basilar membrane and basilar membrane displacement gave direct evidence for power amplification in the cochlea. Moreover, the results showed a phase shift of voltage relative to mechanical responses at frequencies slightly below the peak, near the onset of amplification. Based on the voltage-force relationship of isolated OHCs, the shift would give rise to effective OHC pumping forces within the traveling wave peak. Thus, the shift activates the cochlear amplifier, serving to localize and thus sharpen the frequency region of amplification. These results are the most concrete evidence for cochlear power amplification to date and support OHC somatic forces as its source.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To explore the modulation of auditory steady-state response (ASSR) by experimental tasks, differing in attentional focus and arousal level.

METHODS:20 Hz and 40 Hz click trains were used to elicit ASSRs. Experiment 1 consisted of two runs of closed eyes and two runs of open eyes. Experiment 2 consisted of six tasks: counting 20 Hz and 40 Hz stimuli, sitting with closed and open eyes, reading an article, and performing a search task. Phase locking factor, evoked amplitude and total intensity were decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization.

RESULTS:The total intensity of 40 Hz ASSR was enhanced during closed eyes condition in comparison to the open eyes condition. The evoked amplitude and phase locking factor of 40 Hz ASSR were attenuated during distraction, while there were no differences between attention to stimulation and no task. 20 Hz ASSR and 20 Hz ASSR-related 40 Hz activity were not modulated by the tasks.

CONCLUSIONS:The phase-locked measures of 40 Hz ASSR are attenuated when attention to the stimulation is low, i.e. the subject is effortfully focused on the competitive "distraction" task performance. Lower arousal level increases the total intensity of 40 Hz ASSRs.

SIGNIFICANCE:Improvements of the practical use of ASSRs are suggested: a careful monitoring for arousal fluctuations during ASSR recordings should be performed; when ASSRs are applied to investigate the ability to generate high frequency cortical activity a "distraction" task is not favorable.},

abstract = {To further understand the roles and origins of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the efferent innervation of the cochlea, we first produced in the mouse an immunocytochemical map of the efferent terminals that contain acetylcholine (ACh), CGRP, and GABA. Olivocochlear (OC) terminals in inner and outer hair cell (IHC and OHC) regions were analyzed quantitatively along the cochlear spiral via light-microscopic observation of cochlear wholemounts immunostained with antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAT), or the peptide CGRP. Further immunochemical characterization was performed in mice with chronic OC transection at the floor of the fourth ventricle to distinguish crossed from uncrossed contributions and, indirectly, the contributions of lateral versus medial components of the OC system. The results in mouse showed that (1) there are prominent GABAergic, cholinergic, and CGRPergic innervations in the OHC and IHC regions, (2) GABA and CGRP are extensively colocalized with ACh in all OC terminals in the IHC and OHC areas, (3) the longitudinal gradient of OC innervation peaks roughly at the 10-kHz region in the OHC area and is more uniform along the cochlear spiral in the IHC area, (4) in contrast to other mammalian species there is no radial gradient of OC innervation of the OHCs, and (5) all OHC efferent terminals arise from the medial OC system and terminals in the IHC area arise from the lateral OC system.},

abstract = {Spatial receptive fields of primary auditory (AI) neurons were studied by delivering, binaurally, synthesized virtual-space signals via earphones to cats under barbiturate anesthesia. Signals were broadband or narrowband transients presented in quiet anechoic space or in acoustic space filled with uncorrelated continuous broadband noise. In the absence of background noise, AI virtual space receptive fields (VSRFs) are typically large, representing a quadrant or more of acoustic space. Within the receptive field, onset latency and firing strength form functional gradients. We hypothesized earlier that functional gradients in the receptive field provide information about sound-source direction. Previous studies indicated that spatial gradients could remain relatively constant across changes in signal intensity. In the current experiments we tested the hypothesis that directional sensitivity to a transient signal, as reflected in the gradient structure of VSRFs of AI neurons, is also retained in the presence of a continuous background noise. When background noise was introduced three major affects on VSRFs were observed. 1) The size of the VSRF was reduced, accompanied by a reduction of firing strength and lengthening of response latency for signals at an acoustic axis and on-lines of constant azimuth and elevation passing through the acoustic axis. These effects were monotonically related to the intensity of the background noise over a noise intensity range of approximately 30 dB. 2) The noise intensity-dependent changes in VSRFs were mirrored by the changes that occurred when the signal intensity was changed in signal-alone conditions. Thus adding background noise was equivalent to a shift in the threshold of a directional signal, and this shift was seen across the spatial receptive field. 3) The spatial gradients of response strength and latency remained evident over the range of background noise intensity that reduced spike count and lengthened onset latency. Those gradients along the azimuth that spanned the frontal midline tended to remain constant in slope and position in the face of increasing intensity of background noise. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that, under background noise conditions, information that underlies directional acuity and accuracy is retained within the spatial receptive fields of an ensemble of AI neurons.},

abstract = {The mammalian cochlea is a structure comprising a number of components connected by elastic elements. A mechanical system of this kind is expected to have multiple normal modes of oscillation and associated resonances. The guinea pig cochlear mechanics was probed using distortion components generated in the cochlea close to the place of overlap between two tones presented simultaneously. Otoacoustic emissions at frequencies of the distortion components were recorded in the ear canal. The phase behavior of the emissions reveals the presence of a nonlinear resonance at a frequency about a half octave below that of the high-frequency primary tone. The location of the resonance is level dependent and the resonance shifts to lower frequencies with increasing stimulus intensity. This resonance is thought to be associated with the tectorial membrane. The resonance tends to minimize input to the cochlear receptor cells at frequencies below the high-frequency primary and increases the dynamic load to the stereocilia of the receptor cells at the primary frequency when the tectorial membrane and reticular lamina move in counterphase.},

abstract = {An experiment was performed that measured, for the frontal audio-visual horizon, how accurately listeners could localize a female-voice target amidst four spatially distributed male-voice maskers. To examine whether listeners can make use of a priori knowledge about the configuration of the sources, performance was examined in two conditions: either the masker locations were fixed (in one of five known patterns) or the locations varied from trial to trial. The presence of maskers disrupted speech localization, even after accounting for reduced target detectability. Averaged across all target locations, the rms error in responses decreased by 20% when a priori knowledge about masker locations was available. The effect was even stronger for the target locations that did not coincide with the maskers (error reduction of 36%), while no change in errors was observed for targets coinciding with maskers. The benefits were reduced when the target-to-masker intensity ratio was increased or when the maskers were in a pattern that made it difficult to make use of the a priori information. The results confirm that localization in speech mixtures is modified by the listener's expectations about the spatial arrangement of the sources.},

abstract = {The medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) has been hypothesized to provide benefit for listening in noise. Strong physiological support for an anti-masking role for the MOCR has come from the observation that auditory nerve (AN) fibers exhibit reduced firing to sustained noise and increased sensitivity to tones when the MOCR is elicited. The present study extended a well-established computational model for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired AN responses to demonstrate that these anti-masking effects can be accounted for by reducing outer hair cell (OHC) gain, which is a primary effect of the MOCR. Tone responses in noise were examined systematically as a function of tone level, noise level, and OHC gain. Signal detection theory was used to predict detection and discrimination for different spontaneous rate fiber groups. Decreasing OHC gain decreased the sustained noise response and increased maximum discharge rate to the tone, thus modeling the ability of the MOCR to decompress AN fiber rate-level functions. Comparing the present modeling results with previous data from AN fibers in decerebrate cats suggests that the ipsilateral masking noise used in the physiological study may have elicited up to 20 dB of OHC gain reduction in addition to that inferred from the contralateral noise effects. Reducing OHC gain in the model also extended the dynamic range for discrimination over a wide range of background noise levels. For each masker level, an optimal OHC gain reduction was predicted (i.e., where maximum discrimination was achieved without increased detection threshold). These optimal gain reductions increased with masker level and were physiologically realistic. Thus, reducing OHC gain can improve tone-in-noise discrimination even though it may produce a {\textquotedblleft}hearing loss{\textquotedblright} in quiet. Combining MOCR effects with the sensorineural hearing loss effects already captured by this computational AN model will be beneficial for exploring the implications of their interaction for the difficulties hearing-impaired listeners have in noisy situations.},

abstract = {In order to pinpoint the location of a sound source, we make use of a variety of spatial cues that arise from the direction-dependent manner in which sounds interact with the head, torso and external ears. Accurate sound localization relies on the neural discrimination of tiny differences in the values of these cues and requires that the brain circuits involved be calibrated to the cues experienced by each individual. There is growing evidence that the capacity for recalibrating auditory localization continues well into adult life. Many details of how the brain represents auditory space and of how those representations are shaped by learning and experience remain elusive. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the task of processing auditory spatial information is distributed over different regions of the brain, some working hierarchically, others independently and in parallel, and each apparently using different strategies for encoding sound source location.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Ninety percent of all newborns in the United States are now screened for hearing loss before they leave the hospital. Many hospitals use a 2-stage protocol for newborn hearing screening in which all infants are screened first with otoacoustic emissions (OAE). No additional testing is done with infants who pass the OAE, but infants who fail the OAE next are screened with automated auditory brainstem response (A-ABR). Infants who fail the A-ABR screening are referred for diagnostic testing to determine whether they have permanent hearing loss (PHL). Those who pass the A-ABR are considered at low risk for hearing loss and are not tested further. The objective of this multicenter study was to determine whether a substantial number of infants who fail the initial OAE and pass the A-ABR have PHL at approximately 9 months of age.

METHODS:Seven birthing centers with successful newborn hearing screening programs using a 2-stage OAE/A-ABR screening protocol participated. During the study period, 86634 infants were screened for hearing loss at these sites. Of those infants who failed the OAE but passed the A-ABR in at least 1 ear, 1524 were enrolled in the study. Data about prenatal, neonatal, and socioeconomic factors, plus hearing loss risk indicators, were collected for all enrolled infants. When the infants were an average of 9.7 months of age, diagnostic audiologic evaluations were done for 64% of the enrolled infants (1432 ears from 973 infants).

RESULTS:Twenty-one infants (30 ears) who had failed the OAE but passed the A-ABR during the newborn hearing screening were identified with permanent bilateral or unilateral hearing loss. Twenty-three (77%) of the ears had mild hearing loss (average of 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz < or =40-decibel hearing level). Nine (43%) infants had bilateral as opposed to unilateral loss, and 18 (86%) infants had sensorineural as opposed to permanent conductive hearing loss.

CONCLUSIONS:If all infants were screened for hearing loss using the 2-stage OAE/A-ABR newborn hearing screening protocol currently used in many hospitals, then approximately 23% of those with PHL at approximately 9 months of age would have passed the A-ABR. This happens in part because much of the A-ABR screening equipment in current use was designed to identify infants with moderate or greater hearing loss. Thus, program administrators should be certain that the screening program, equipment, and protocols are designed to identify the type of hearing loss targeted by their program. The results also show the need for continued surveillance of hearing status during childhood.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: The objective of this study was to examine the role of the acoustic stapedius reflex in the protection of speech recognition from the upward spread of masking arising from low-frequency background noise. DESIGN:: Speech recognition scores were measured for nine control participants (19-34 years) and six patients with transected stapedius tendons poststapedotomy (39-57 years) as a function of the amplitude of a low-frequency masker, presented at nominal signal to noise ratios of +5 dB, -5 dB, and -15 dB. All participants had pure-tone hearing thresholds in the normal range. Continuous high-pass noise was present in all conditions to avoid ceiling effects; this reduced performance in quiet to approximately 85% for all participants. Scores were measured for soft and loud nonsense syllables (average third octave band levels of 35 and 65 dB SPL), so that a comparison of the low-frequency noise masking functions at the two levels would provide information about the effects of the reflex on speech intelligibility in noise. A third group of nine control participants (19-22 years) listened in the presence of a low-frequency masker gated to come on 1 sec before stimulus onset, to reduce the likelihood of reflex adaptation. The Speech-Intelligibility Index was used to quantify the amount of speech information available in each condition. RESULTS:: Patients with transected tendons performed more poorly than control participants as a function of Speech-Intelligibility Index in all conditions, even at levels that were too soft for reflex activation. This could be because of postsurgical differences in sensitivity, the more advanced age of poststapedotomy group, or differences in medial olivocochlear inhibition. For loud speech, patient performance fell nearly linearly with increases in the low-frequency masker, but control participants' performance declined little as the signal to noise ratio declined from +5 to -5 dB, and then fell rapidly as the ratio declined to -15 dB. This plateau in the masking function did not occur for the patients. Masking functions obtained with the gated low-frequency masker were either highly similar or poorer to those obtained with a continuous masker, suggesting that the use of a continuous low frequency masker did not result in significant reflex adaptation. CONCLUSIONS:: The stapedius reflex appears to offer some protection from the upward spread of masking of speech by background low-frequency noise at moderate levels, but not at high levels.},

abstract = {Developmental dyslexia is generally believed to result from impaired linguistic processing rather than from deficits in low-level sensory function. Challenging this view, we studied the perception of non-verbal acoustic stimuli and low-level auditory evoked potentials in dyslexic adults. Compared with matched controls, dyslexics were selectively impaired in tasks (frequency discrimination and binaural unmasking) which rely on decoding neural discharges phase-locked to the fine structure of the stimulus. Furthermore, this ability to use phase-locking was related to reading ability. In addition, the evoked potential reflecting phase-locked discharges was significantly smaller in dyslexics. These results demonstrate a low-level auditory impairment in dyslexia traceable to the brainstem nuclei.},

abstract = {In the mammalian cochlea, acoustic information is carried to the brain by the predominant (95%) large-diameter, myelinated type I afferents, each of which is postsynaptic to a single inner hair cell. The remaining thin, unmyelinated type II afferents extend hundreds of microns along the cochlear duct to contact many outer hair cells. Despite this extensive arbor, type II afferents are weakly activated by outer hair cell transmitter release and are insensitive to sound. Intriguingly, type II afferents remain intact in damaged regions of the cochlea. Here, we show that type II afferents are activated when outer hair cells are damaged. This response depends on both ionotropic (P2X) and metabotropic (P2Y) purinergic receptors, binding ATP released from nearby supporting cells in response to hair cell damage. Selective activation of P2Y receptors increased type II afferent excitability by the closure of KCNQ-type potassium channels, a potential mechanism for the painful hypersensitivity (that we term "noxacusis" to distinguish from hyperacusis without pain) that can accompany hearing loss. Exposure to the KCNQ channel activator retigabine suppressed the type II fiber's response to hair cell damage. Type II afferents may be the cochlea's nociceptors, prompting avoidance of further damage to the irreparable inner ear.},

abstract = {In keeping with our promise earlier in this review, we summarize here the process by which we believe spatial cues are used for localizing a sound source in a free-field listening situation. We believe it entails two parallel processes: 1. The azimuth of the source is determined using differences in interaural time or interaural intensity, whichever is present. Wightman and colleagues (1989) believe the low-frequency temporal information is dominant if both are present. 2. The elevation of the source is determined from spectral shape cues. The received sound spectrum, as modified by the pinna, is in effect compared with a stored set of directional transfer functions. These are actually the spectra of a nearly flat source heard at various elevations. The elevation that corresponds to the best-matching transfer function is selected as the locus of the sound. Pinnae are similar enough between people that certain general rules (e.g. Blauert's boosted bands or Butler's covert peaks) can describe this process. Head motion is probably not a critical part of the localization process, except in cases where time permits a very detailed assessment of location, in which case one tries to localize the source by turning the head toward the putative location. Sound localization is only moderately more precise when the listener points directly toward the source. The process is not analogous to localizing a visual source on the fovea of the retina. Thus, head motion provides only a moderate increase in localization accuracy. Finally, current evidence does not support the view that auditory motion perception is anything more than detection of changes in static location over time.},

In 124 children, standard scores from the subtest suggested a binaural integration deficit in 23% of the children tested. Because standard scores are derived from the combined scores of both ears during the test, children with normal performance in one ear and weak performance in the other ear may be overlooked. For these children, a measure of interaural asymmetry may be a more sensitive indicator of a binaural integration deficit. When an age-appropriate criterion for interaural asymmetry from the Competing Words Subtest was used, the incidence of a binaural integration deficit increased to 51% of the children tested. Four typical patterns of dichotic listening performance were identified based on results from the two scoring techniques.},

abstract = {Localized intracochlear injections of the fluorescent retrograde label diamidino yellow were used to investigate the organization of efferent projections from the brainstem to different turns of the cochlea, in the guinea pig. It was found that the location of small neurones within the lateral superior olive ipsilateral to the injection varied in a systematic manner when injections proceeded from base to apex of the cochlea. In addition, a cruder form of cochleotopic organization was present in that most of the large medial system efferent neurones were labelled only after injection into the 3 most basal turns of the cochlea. The decline of medial system efferent innervation proceeding from base to apex was most striking for the contralateral efferent neurones. The details of base to apex innervation density were different for the different nuclei of origin of the medial system, implying the existence of complex subsystems within the medial neurone population.},

abstract = {Developmental dyslexia is associated with impaired speech-in-noise perception. The goal of the present research was to further characterize this deficit in dyslexic adults. In order to specify the mechanisms and processing strategies used by adults with dyslexia during speech-in-noise perception, we explored the influence of background type, presenting single target-words against backgrounds made of cocktail party sounds, modulated speech-derived noise or stationary noise. We also evaluated the effect of three listening configurations differing in terms of the amount of spatial processing required. In a monaural condition, signal and noise were presented to the same ear while in a dichotic situation, target and concurrent sound were presented to two different ears, finally in a spatialised configuration, target and competing signals were presented as if they originated from slightly differing positions in the auditory scene. Our results confirm the presence of a speech-in-noise perception deficit in dyslexic adults, in particular when the competing signal is also speech, and when both signals are presented to the same ear, an observation potentially relating to phonological accounts of dyslexia. However, adult dyslexics demonstrated better levels of spatial release of masking than normal reading controls when the background was speech, suggesting that they are well able to rely on denoising strategies based on spatial auditory scene analysis strategies.},

In the earlier study, differences in peripheral hearing sensitivity between young and elderly subjects were not controlled. In the present study, four groups of young and elderly subjects, matched with respect to age and the presence or absence of sensorineural hearing loss, were examined to determine the effects of these two factors on performance with the PE task. Although significantly poorer performances on the PE task were found to be associated with both increased age and hearing loss, additional tentative evidence was obtained that the presence of hearing loss may have a relatively greater detrimental effect on the performance of at least some elderly subjects than it does on younger persons.},

abstract = {Medial olivocochlear (MOC) influence on cochlear mechanics can be noninvasively, albeit indirectly, explored via the effects of contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS) on otoacoustic emissions. CAS-mediated effects are particularly pronounced for spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs), which are typically reduced in amplitude and shifted upward in frequency by CAS. We investigated whether similar frequency shifts and magnitude reductions were observed behaviorally in the fine structure of pure-tone hearing thresholds, a phenomenon thought to share a common underlying mechanism with SOAEs. In normal-hearing listeners, fine-resolution thresholds were obtained over a narrow frequency range centered on the frequency of an SOAE, both in the absence and presence of 60-dB SPL broadband CAS. While CAS shifted threshold fine structure patterns and SOAEs upward in frequency by a comparable amount, little reduction in the presence or depth of fine structure was observed at frequencies near those of SOAEs. In fact, CAS typically improved thresholds, particularly at threshold minima, and increased fine structure depth when reductions in the amplitude of the associated SOAE were less than 10 dB. Additional measurements made at frequencies distant from SOAEs, or near SOAEs that were more dramatically reduced in amplitude by the CAS, revealed that CAS tended to elevate thresholds and reduce threshold fine structure depth. The results suggest that threshold fine structure is sensitive to MOC-mediated changes in cochlear gain, but that SOAEs complicate the interpretation of threshold measurements at nearby frequencies, perhaps due to masking or other interference effects. Both threshold fine structure and SOAEs may be significant sources of intersubject and intrasubject variability in psychoacoustic investigations of MOC function.},

abstract = {Simulations of hearing impairment were presented to the normal ears of subjects with moderate to severe unilateral cochlear hearing loss. The intelligibility of speech in quiet and in background sounds was compared with that obtained for the impaired ears using unprocessed stimuli. The results of loudness matches between the two ears were used to tailor a simulation of threshold elevation combined with loudness recruitment individually for each subject. This was assessed either alone, or in combination with a simulation of reduced frequency selectivity, performed by spectral smearing. Finally, we included a simulation of 'dead' regions in the cochlea, where there are assumed to be no functioning inner hair cells and/or neurones, by band-stop filtering over the frequency range corresponding to the dead region. Performance for the impaired ears was markedly worse than for the normal ears using the simulation of threshold elevation and loudness recruitment. The addition of the simulation of reduced frequency selectivity caused performance to worsen, but it remained above that for the impaired ears. The additional simulation of a dead region had little effect, except for one subject, for whom it produced performance comparable to that for the impaired ear in quiet but not when background sounds were present. It is suggested that the relatively poor results for the impaired ears may be caused partly by a form of 'neglect' which is specific to subjects with unilateral or asymmetric loss. This idea was supported by results obtained using bilaterally hearing-impaired subjects, which were markedly better than for the impaired ears of the unilaterally hearing-impaired subjects, and comparable to those for the normal ears listening to the combined simulation of threshold elevation, loudness recruitment and reduced frequency selectivity.},

abstract = {Models of the auditory and phonetic analysis of speech must account for the ability of listeners to extract information from speech when competing voices are present. When two synthetic vowels are presented simultaneously and monaurally, listeners can exploit cues provided by a difference in fundamental frequency (F0) between the vowels to help determine their phonemic identities. Three experiments examined the effects of stimulus duration on the perception of such "double vowels." Experiment 1 confirmed earlier findings that a difference in F0 provides a smaller advantage when the duration of the stimulus is brief (50 ms rather than 200 ms). With brief stimuli, there may be insufficient time for attentional mechanisms to switch from the "dominant" member of the pair to the "nondominant" vowel. Alternatively, brief segments may restrict the availability of cues that are distributed over the time course of a longer segment of a double vowel. In experiment 1, listeners did not perform better when the same 50-ms segment was presented four times in succession (with 100-ms silent intervals) rather than only once, suggesting that limits on attention switching do not underlie the duration effect. However, performance improved in some conditions when four successive 50-ms segments were extracted from the 200-ms double vowels and presented in sequence, again with 100-ms silent intervals. Similar improvements were observed in experiment 2 between performance with the first 50-ms segment and one or more of the other three segments when the segments were presented individually. Experiment 3 demonstrated that part of the improvement observed in experiments 1 and 2 could be attributed to waveform interactions that either reinforce or attenuate harmonics that lie near vowel formants. Such interactions were beneficial only when the difference in F0 was small (0.25-1 semitone). These results are compatible with the idea that listeners benefit from small differences in F0 by performing a sequence of analyses of different time segments of a double vowel to determine where the formants of the constituent vowels are best defined.},

abstract = {The ability to localize a click train in the frontal-horizontal plane was measured in quiet and in the presence of a white-noise masker. The experiment tested the effects of signal frequency, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and masker location. Clicks were low-pass filtered at 11 kHz in the broadband condition, low-pass filtered at 1.6 kHz in the low-pass condition, and bandpass filtered between 1.6 and 11 kHz in the high-pass condition. The masker was presented at either -90, 0, or +90 deg azimuth. Six signal-to-noise ratios were used, ranging from -9 to +18 dB. Results obtained with four normal-hearing listeners show that (1) for all masker locations and filtering conditions, localization accuracy remains unaffected by noise until 0-6 dB S/N and decreases at more adverse signal-to-noise ratios, (2) for all filtering conditions and at low signal-to-noise ratios, the effect of noise is greater when noise is presented at +/- 90 deg azimuth than at 0 deg azimuth, (3) the effect of noise is similar for all filtering conditions when noise is presented at 0 deg azimuth, and (4) when noise is presented at +/- 90 deg azimuth, the effect of noise is similar for the broadband and high-pass conditions, but greater for the low-pass condition. These results suggest that the low- and high-frequency cues used to localize sounds are equally affected when noise is presented at 0 deg azimuth. However, low-frequency cues are less resistant to noise than high-frequency cues when noise is presented at +/- 90 deg azimuth. When both low- and high-frequency cues are available, listeners base their decision on the cues providing the most accurate estimation of the direction of the sound source (high-frequency cues). Parallel measures of click detectability suggest that the poorer localization accuracy observed when noise is at +/- 90 deg azimuth may be caused by a reduction in the detectability of the signal at the ear ipsilateral to the noise.},

abstract = {Amplitude modulation encoding is critical for human speech perception and complex sound processing in general. The modulation transfer function (MTF) is a staple of auditory psychophysics, and has been shown to predict speech intelligibility performance in a range of adverse listening conditions and hearing impairments, including cochlear implant-supported hearing. Although both tonal and broadband carriers have been used in psychophysical studies of modulation detection and discrimination, relatively little is known about differences in the cortical representation of such signals. We obtained MTFs in response to sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) for both narrowband tonal carriers and two-octave bandwidth noise carriers in the auditory core of awake squirrel monkeys. MTFs spanning modulation frequencies from 4 to 512 Hz were obtained using 16 channel linear recording arrays sampling across all cortical laminae. Carrier frequency for tonal SAM and center frequency for noise SAM was set at the estimated BF for each penetration. Changes in carrier type affected both rate and temporal MTFs in many neurons. Using spike discrimination techniques, we found that discrimination of modulation frequency was significantly better for tonal SAM than for noise SAM, though the differences were modest at the population level. Moreover, spike trains elicited by tonal and noise SAM could be readily discriminated in most cases. Collectively, our results reveal remarkable sensitivity to the spectral content of modulated signals, and indicate substantial interdependence between temporal and spectral processing in neurons of the core auditory cortex.},

abstract = {In order to get a systematic picture of how various hearing impairments and neurologic disorders may affect sound localization, psychophysical spatial- and lateralization-discrimination measurements were performed on 140 subjects, including 69 with different types of hearing impairments, 32 with neurological diseases, and 39 with normal hearing. The quantities measured were: in the freefield, the horizontal minimum audible angle (MAA) at eight reference azimuths around the head and the vertical MAA straight ahead; with headphones, the just-noticeable difference (JND) in interaural time delay and the JND in interaural intensity difference. The standard stimulus was broadband (0.25-10 kHz), pulsed (1-sec), noise presented at a suprathreshold level for both ears (65-100 dB SPL). The results show that there exist characteristic impairments of sound localization in the different types of hearing impairments tested. On a general level, the results are consistent with the concept that the localization of sound relies on a decision made by the central auditory system based on a number of cues present in the acoustic signal at the two ears. The cues tested in our study are: 1) the interaural time difference, 2) the interaural intensity difference, and 3) the spectrum of the received signal at each ear. At a more specific level, the sound localization impairments found in conductive hearing losses are interpreted as bone-conduction effects, the results found in sensorineural hearing losses are interpreted as consequences of impaired or preserved spectral processing, the results in neurinomas are interpreted as impaired signal transmission in the auditory nerves, and the results of subjects with central involvements suggest that separate processors exist at some level in the central auditory system for the different localization cues. Finally, comments are made about the practical clinical significance of sound localization tests in the audiological and neurological evaluation of patients.},

abstract = {Background noise poses a significant obstacle for auditory perception, especially among individuals with hearing loss. To better understand the physiological basis of this perceptual impediment, the present study evaluated the effects of background noise on the auditory nerve representation of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). These complex spectral shapes describe the directional filtering effects of the head and torso. When a broadband sound passes through the outer ear en route to the tympanic membrane, the HRTF alters its spectrum in a manner that establishes the perceived location of the sound source. HRTF-shaped noise shares many of the acoustic features of human speech, while communicating biologically relevant localization cues that are generalized across mammalian species. Previous studies have used parametric manipulations of random spectral shapes to elucidate HRTF coding principles at various stages of the cat's auditory system. This study extended that body of work by examining the effects of sound level and background noise on the quality of spectral coding in the auditory nerve. When fibers were classified by their spontaneous rates, the coding properties of the more numerous low-threshold, high-spontaneous rate fibers were found to degrade at high presentation levels and in low signal-to-noise ratios. Because cats are known to maintain accurate directional hearing under these challenging listening conditions, behavioral performance may be disproportionally based on the enhanced dynamic range of the less common high-threshold, low-spontaneous rate fibers.},

The intelligibility tests were performed in 41 classrooms in 12 different schools evenly divided among grades 1, 3, and 6 students (nominally 6, 8, and 11 year olds). Speech intelligibility tests were carried out on classes of students seated at their own desks in their regular classrooms. Mean intelligibility scores were significantly related to signal-to-noise ratios and to the grade of the students. While the results are different than those from some previous laboratory studies that included less realistic conditions, they agree with previous in-classroom experiments. The results indicate that +15 dB signal-to-noise ratio is not adequate for the youngest children. By combining the speech intelligibility test results with measurements of speech and noise levels during actual teaching situations, estimates of the fraction of students experiencing near-ideal acoustical conditions were made. The results are used as a basis for estimating ideal acoustical criteria for elementary school classrooms.},

abstract = {The present data were collected in humans to characterize the effects of monaural and binaural stimulation and contralateral noise on the 2f1-f2 distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) adaptation response. DPOAE levels (f2/f1=1.21, L1=70 dB SPL, L2=65 dB SPL) were measured in both ears for a range of f2 frequencies (1.2 to 10.0 kHz). The f2 frequency producing the largest amplitude DPOAE was used for further testing employing three different stimulus conditions: the primary tones were presented to only one ear for 4 s; the two tones were presented simultaneously in both ears; and, contralateral broadband noise (60 dB SPL) was presented for 5 s, beginning 4 s after the onset of the monaural primaries in the test ear. Acoustic reflex thresholds were measured to verify that the middle-ear muscles played no systematic role in the measured DPOAE reductions. Estimates of monaural rapid adaptation levels and time constants agreed well with previous human findings. The magnitude of the rapid adaptation under binaural stimulation, as compared with monaural primaries, was 25% greater on average, though adaptation time constants were comparable. With added contralateral noise, the average DPOAE suppression was 1.1 dB (0.3-2.7 dB). The magnitude of the monaural adaptation and the effects of binaural and contralateral stimulation, however, were smaller than those measured previously in experimental animals, though the time constants were in good agreement.},

abstract = {The different response characteristics of the different auditory cortical responses under conventional central masking conditions were examined by comparing the effects of contralateral white noise on the cortical component of 40-Hz auditory steady state fields (ASSFs) and the N100 m component in auditory evoked fields (AEFs) for tone bursts using a helmet-shaped magnetoencephalography system in 8 healthy volunteers (7 males, mean age 32.6 years). The ASSFs were elicited by monaural 1000 Hz amplitude modulation tones at 80 dB SPL, with the amplitude modulated at 39 Hz. The AEFs were elicited by monaural 1000 Hz tone bursts of 60 ms duration (rise and fall times of 10 ms, plateau time of 40 ms) at 80 dB SPL. The results indicated that continuous white noise at 70 dB SPL presented to the contralateral ear did not suppress the N100 m response in either hemisphere, but significantly reduced the amplitude of the 40-Hz ASSF in both hemispheres with asymmetry in that suppression of the 40-Hz ASSF was greater in the right hemisphere. Different effects of contralateral white noise on these two responses may reflect different functional auditory processes in the cortices.},

abstract = {Integration of information from multiple senses is fundamental to perception and cognition, but when and where this is accomplished in the brain is not well understood. This study examined the timing and topography of cortical auditory-visual interactions using high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) during a simple reaction-time (RT) task. Visual and auditory stimuli were presented alone and simultaneously. ERPs elicited by the auditory and visual stimuli when presented alone were summed ('sum' ERP) and compared to the ERP elicited when they were presented simultaneously ('simultaneous' ERP). Divergence between the 'simultaneous' and 'sum' ERP indicated auditory-visual (AV) neural response interactions. There was a surprisingly early right parieto-occipital AV interaction, consistent with the finding of an earlier study [J. Cogn. Neurosci. 11 (1999) 473]. The timing of onset of this effect (46 ms) was essentially simultaneous with the onset of visual cortical processing, as indexed by the onset of the visual C1 component, which is thought to represent the earliest cortical visual evoked potential. The coincident timing of the early AV interaction and C1 strongly suggests that AV interactions can affect early visual sensory processing. Additional AV interactions were found within the time course of sensory processing (up to 200 ms post stimulus onset). In total, this system of AV effects over the scalp was suggestive of both activity unique to multisensory processing, and the modulation of 'unisensory' activity. RTs to the stimuli when presented simultaneously were significantly faster than when they were presented alone. This RT facilitation could not be accounted for by probability summation, as evidenced by violation of the 'race' model, providing compelling evidence that auditory-visual neural interactions give rise to this RT effect.},

abstract = {1. The antimasking effects of olivocochlear (OC) efferent feedback were studied in anesthetized or decerebrate cats by comparing responses of single auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs) to tone bursts in continuous masking noise seen with and without addition of a moderate-level contralateral noise known to activate the OC reflex. Responses were measured as a function of tone-burst intensity, tone-burst frequency, and masker intensity and were analyzed so as to allow quantitative estimates of the detectability of the tone bursts against the noise background. 2. Addition of the contralateral OC elicitor both increased the maximum discharge rates to the masked tone bursts and decreased the rates to the ipsilateral masker. The rate increases to the tone bursts could be explained on the basis of a decrease in adaptation caused by decreasing the steady response to the masker. The result is a steepening of the rate-versus-level function for masked tone bursts and a concomitant increase in the estimated discriminability of small increments of tone-burst intensity. 3. For tone bursts at the fiber's characteristic frequency (CF), the OC effects on detection threshold for the masked tone bursts depended on masker level, with small increases in threshold for low masker levels and somewhat larger decreases in threshold for higher masker levels. For tone bursts below CF, OC effects, when present, always decreased the detection threshold. 4. The largest antimasking effects were seen for fibers with CFs between 6 and 12 kHz and for masker levels within 20 dB of the fiber's threshold to the masker. These trends appeared to hold for fibers of all spontaneous rates (SRs). 5. Enhancement of the response to unmasked tone bursts and concomitant decrease in the "spontaneous rate" was elicited by OC activation in fibers if threshold sensitivity approached -10 dB SPL. This "enhancement-in-quiet" appears to arise when an animal-generated noise produces a continuous response (in the absence of purposely applied sound) that is suppressed by OC activity. This finding raises questions as to the range of "true" spontaneous rates in the cat. 6. The results highlight two important distinctions between the effects of OC feedback in quiet versus those in noise. In quiet, the effects are predominately suppressive and are restricted to stimuli at frequencies near a fiber's CF and at intensities within its dynamic range. In continuous background noise, the OC reflex can enhance the responses to transient stimuli. Such effects are seen throughout the fiber's response area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {12 young men (mean age = 39.1 years) and 12 older men (mean age = 69.4 years) presenting some degree of sensorineural hearing loss were chosen so that the two groups were audiometrically matched. Behavioral tests of binaural interaction (BI) included binaural fusion, rapidly alternating speech perception, and masking level difference (at 500 Hz). There was a tendency toward better performance by the younger subjects for each of these tests, but these comparisons fell short of statistical significance. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and middle-latency responses (MLRs) to clicks were recorded in both monaural and binaural modes, with off-line derivation of BI components. Latencies of wave V (in ABR) and waves Pa and Nb (in MLR) were prolonged in the older subjects for all conditions; this effect was independent of degree of hearing loss. BI components did not differ substantially between the two groups, except for a 0.45-ms latency difference for the 'N1' peak, as expected from the raw ABR data. MLRs for both groups showed a pattern of BI which was different from that seen in young subjects with normal hearing, in that latency for wave Pa in MLR was not reduced in the binaural condition. The young subjects showed the expected reduction of binaural wave Pa amplitude compared to monaural sum responses, while the older subjects, as a group, did not. No significant correlations were found between behavioral and electrophysiological tests.},

abstract = {This study investigated the degree to which two types of reduced auditory signals (cochlear implant simulations) and visual speech cues combined for speech identification. The auditory speech stimuli were filtered to have only amplitude envelope cues or both amplitude envelope and spectral cues and were presented with/without visual speech. In Experiment 1, IEEE sentences were presented in quiet and noise. For in-quiet presentation, speech identification was enhanced by the addition of both spectral and visual speech cues. Due to a ceiling effect, the degree to which these effects combined could not be determined. In noise, these facilitation effects were more marked and were additive. Experiment 2 examined consonant and vowel identification in the context of CVC or VCV syllables presented in noise. For consonants, both spectral and visual speech cues facilitated identification and these effects were additive. For vowels, the effect of combined cues was underadditive, with the effect of spectral cues reduced when presented with visual speech cues. Analysis indicated that without visual speech, spectral cues facilitated the transmission of place information and vowel height, whereas with visual speech, they facilitated lip rounding, with little impact on the transmission of place information.},

abstract = {These experiments simulated the threshold elevation and loudness recruitment associated with three different types of cochlear hearing loss: Moderate flat (condition R2), severe flat (condition R3), and moderate-to-severe sloping (condition RX). This was done to allow an examination of the effects of these factors on the intelligibility of speech, in isolation from other factors that are normally associated with cochlear hearing loss, such as reduced frequency selectivity. The simulation was performed by splitting the input signal into 13 frequency bands, and processing the envelope in each band so as to create loudness sensations in a normal ear that would resemble those produced in an impaired ear with recruitment. The bands were then recombined. All tests were performed using subjects with normal hearing. For speech in quiet, simulation of hearing loss produced a reduction in the ability to understand low-level speech. However, speech at sufficiently high levels was highly intelligible in all conditions. Linear amplification according to the National Acoustic Laboratory (NAL) prescription gave high intelligibility for speech at normal conversational levels. For speech presented at a fixed input level of 65 dB SPL, against a background of a single competing talker, simulation of hearing loss produced substantial decrements in performance. The speech-to-background ratios in conditions R2 and RX had to be 11-13 dB higher than in the control condition (unprocessed stimuli) to achieve similar levels of performance. Linear amplification according to the NAL prescription improved performance markedly for the conditions simulating flat losses, but was less effective for the condition simulating a sloping loss. This indicates that threshold elevation combined with recruitment produces a loss of intelligibility for speech in the presence of a single competing talker that is only partly compensated by linear amplification of the type typically used in hearing aids.},

abstract = {By Fourier's theorem, signals can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoids of different frequencies. This is especially relevant for hearing, because the inner ear performs a form of mechanical Fourier transform by mapping frequencies along the length of the cochlear partition. An alternative signal decomposition, originated by Hilbert, is to factor a signal into the product of a slowly varying envelope and a rapidly varying fine time structure. Neurons in the auditory brainstem sensitive to these features have been found in mammalian physiological studies. To investigate the relative perceptual importance of envelope and fine structure, we synthesized stimuli that we call 'auditory chimaeras', which have the envelope of one sound and the fine structure of another. Here we show that the envelope is most important for speech reception, and the fine structure is most important for pitch perception and sound localization. When the two features are in conflict, the sound of speech is heard at a location determined by the fine structure, but the words are identified according to the envelope. This finding reveals a possible acoustic basis for the hypothesized 'what' and 'where' pathways in the auditory cortex.},

abstract = {This study sought to determine whether speech recognition in a modulating noise background can be facilitated by a process attributable to comodulation masking release (CMR). Experiment 1 examined the masked identification of six filtered vowels as a function of the number of comodulated noisebands present. A benefit of increased number was observed, consistent with an interpretation in terms of CMR, although it could not be certain that the basis of the discrimination was word recognition in the semantic sense. Experiment 2 made use of a forced-choice rhyming test in which the response foils differed only in a single filtered consonant; again, the measure of interest was performance as a function of the number of comodulated noisebands present. No evidence for a suprathreshold CMR was observed. Experiment 3 made use of open-set sentence material and employed a different paradigm, which allowed a measure of CMR in terms of the difference between thresholds in correlated and uncorrelated noise to be determined. While a CMR for speech detection was observed, no CMR for speech recognition was found. It was concluded that CMR is most evident in masked detection tasks and that diminishing returns are encountered as the signal-to-masker ratio is raised.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of binaural interference, where binaural judgments of a high-frequency target stimulus are disrupted by the presence of a simultaneous low-frequency interferer, can largely be explained using principles of auditory grouping and segregation. Evidence for this relationship comes from a number of previous studies showing that the manipulation of simultaneous grouping cues such as harmonicity and onset synchrony can influence the strength of the phenomenon. In this study, it is shown that sequential grouping cues can also influence whether binaural interference occurs. Subjects indicated the lateral position of a high-frequency sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tone containing an interaural time difference. Perceived lateral positions were reduced by the presence of a simultaneous diotic low-frequency SAM tone, but were largely restored when the interferer was "captured" in a stream of identical tones. A control condition confirmed that the effect was not due to peripheral adaptation. The data lend further support to the idea that binaural interference is affected by processes related to the perceptual organization of auditory information. Modifications to existing grouping-based models are proposed that may help account for binaural interference effects more successfully.},

abstract = {Three experiments investigated the forward masking of brief sinusoids by bursts of noise for masker durations of between 5 and 320 ms and for masker-signal delays between 5 and 40 ms. Experiment 1 showed that, for a 2-kHz signal and a 5-ms delay, long-duration maskers produced much more masking than brief maskers of the same spectrum level. As masker-signal delay was increased, thresholds dropped more rapidly for long than for brief maskers, so that at a delay of 40 ms the difference between thresholds produced by long and by brief maskers was reduced. Experiment 2 showed that, for a 2-kHz signal, the transition from simultaneous masking to forward masking was accompanied by a large drop of about 23 dB in threshold. For a 250-Hz signal this large drop did not occur until masker-signal delay was increased from 10 to 20 ms. For shorter masker-signal delays, brief 250-Hz maskers produced thresholds higher than those produced by longer maskers. The results of Experiment 2 are consistent with the idea that ringing on the basilar membrane causes the responses to masker and signal to overlap for delay times up to 10 ms. Experiment 3 compared the recovery functions for 3 markers of different durations, where the masker levels were adjusted so that each produced equal masking of a 2-kHz signal at a delay of 5 ms. Brief intense maskers produced slower recovery than longer weaker ones, indicating that the recovery from a given amount of forward masking depends on how that masking developed. The implications of this finding for attempts to explain forward masking in terms of short-term adaptation are discussed.},

abstract = {The threshold for detection of a temporal gap in a noiseband was measured. A notched noise masker was used to restrict listening to a limited spectral region. Threshold was measured as a function of center frequency, bandwidth, and level. For a signal bandwidth of one-half the center frequency, the gap threshold decreased from 22.5 ms for a center frequency of 0.2 kHz to 3.2 ms at 8.0 kHz: a wideband condition provided an estimate of 2.3 ms, a value in agreement with previously published estimates. Bandwidth manipulation showed that the variation with frequency was not due to changes in absolute bandwidth alone. The effect of changes in level was determined at three frequencies, 0.4, 1.0, and 6.5 kHz, using a signal bandwidth of half the center frequency. At all frequencies gap threshold decreased as the signal spectrum level was raised from 10 to 25 dB, but a further increase to 40 dB showed no additional improvement. At frequencies up to about 1.0 kHz, the variation of gap threshold with frequency matches well the reciprocal of the bandwidth of the auditory filter, as determined from masking experiments using a notched-noise masker. This suggests that the temporal response of the auditory filter may limit gap detection at low frequencies.},

abstract = {Activation of the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) can be assessed indirectly using transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). The change in TEOAE amplitudes when the MOCR is activated (medial olivocochlear (MOC) shift) has most often been quantified as the mean value in groups of subjects. The usefulness of MOC shift measurements may be increased by the ability to quantify significant shifts in individuals. This study used statistical resampling to quantify significant MOC shifts in 16 subjects. TEOAEs were obtained using transient stimuli containing energy from 1 to 10~kHz. A nonlinear paradigm was used to extract TEOAEs. Transient stimuli were presented at 30~dB sensation level (SL) with suppressor stimuli presented 12~dB higher. Contralateral white noise, used to activate the MOCR, was presented at 30~dB SL and was interleaved on and off in 30-s intervals during a 7-min recording period. Confounding factors of middle ear muscle reflex and slow amplitude drifts were accounted for. TEOAEs were analyzed in 11 1/3-octave frequency bands. The statistical significance of each individual MOC shift was determined using a bootstrap procedure. The minimum detectable MOC shifts ranged from 0.10 to 3.25~dB and were highly dependent on signal-to-noise ratio at each frequency. Subjects exhibited a wide range of magnitudes of significant MOC shifts in the 1.0-3.2-kHz region (median = 1.94~dB, range = 0.34-6.51~dB). There was considerable overlap between the magnitudes of significant and nonsignificant shifts. While most subjects had significant MOC shifts in one or more frequency bands below 4~kHz, few had significant shifts in all of these bands. Above 4~kHz, few significant shifts were seen, but this may have been due to lower signal-to-noise ratios. The specific frequency bands containing significant shifts were variable across individuals. Further work is needed to determine the clinical usefulness of examining MOC shifts in individuals.},

abstract = {Both MEM and MOC systems are sound-evoked reflexes to the auditory periphery which can be elicited by sound in either ear. Both MEM and MOC systems can increase thresholds in the auditory periphery: the MEM system acts by stiffening the ossicular chain, the MOC system by decreasing outer hair cell amplification of sound-induced motion in the inner ear. MEM-induced attenuations are largest for low frequency stimuli, MOC-induced attenuations are largest for mid- to high-frequency sounds. Both MEM and MOC systems can have anti-masking effects. The MEM reflex can decrease the masking of high-frequency signals by low-frequency noise (i.e., the upward spread of masking). The MOC reflex is complementary in that it minimizes masking of high-frequency transient signals by high-frequency continuous noise. MEM anti-masking arises by reducing suppressive masking and can improve masked thresholds at high frequencies. MOC anti-masking arises by counteracting excitatory masking. It does not improve masked thresholds, but can improve the detectability of small suprathreshold intensity increments. Anti-masking effects of both MEM and MOC systems should be reduced in cases of sensorineural hearing loss.},

abstract = {The olivocochlear bundle (OCB) was cut in neonatal cats to evaluate its role in the development of normal cochlear function. Approximately 1 year after deefferentation, acute auditory nerve fiber (ANF) recordings were made from lesioned animals, lesion shams, and normal controls. The degree of deefferentation was quantified via light microscopic evaluation of the density of OCB fascicles in the tunnel of Corti, and selected cases were analyzed via electron microscopy. In the most successful cases, the deefferentation was virtually complete. ANFs from successfully lesioned animals exhibited significant pathophysiology compared with normals and with other animals in which the surgery failed to interrupt the OCB. Thresholds at the characteristic frequency (CF), the frequency at which ANFs are most sensitive, were elevated across the CF range, with maximal effects for CFs in the 10 kHz region. Frequency threshold or tuning curves displayed reduction of tip-to-tail ratios (the difference between CF and low-frequency "tail" thresholds) and decreased sharpness of tuning. These pathological changes are generally associated with outer hair cell (OHC) damage. However, light microscopic histological analysis showed minimal hair cell loss and no significant differences between normal and deefferented groups. Spontaneous discharge rates (SRs) were lower than normal; however, those fibers with the highest SRs remained more sensitive than those with lower SRs. Findings suggest that the interaction between OC efferents and OHCs early in development may be critical for full expression of active mechanical processes.},

abstract = {The benefit for speech intelligibility of extending the bandwidth of hearing aids was assessed when the target speech (sentences) and background (two talkers) were co-located or spatially separated. Also, the relative benefits of slow and fast compression were assessed. Sixteen hearing-impaired (HI) subjects with mild-to-moderate high-frequency hearing loss and eight normal-hearing (NH) subjects were tested. The target and interfering sounds were recorded using a KEMAR manikin and were located at +/-60 degrees azimuth, either co-located or spatially separated. Simulated binaural hearing-aid processing using five-channel slow or fast compression was performed offline, with gains set individually for each HI subject. Upper cutoff frequencies were 5, 7.5, or 10 kHz. Processed stimuli were presented via headphones. For both NH (unaided) and HI subjects, there was no significant effect of cutoff frequency for the co-located condition, but a small but significant benefit from increasing the cutoff frequency from 5 to 7.5 kHz for the spatially separated condition. For the HI subjects, slow compression gave slightly but significantly higher scores than fast compression for the spatially separated but not for the co-located condition. There were marked individual differences both in the benefit from extended bandwidth and in the relative benefit of slow and fast compression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The behavioral binaural masking level difference (BMLD) is believed to reflect brain stem processing. However, this conflicts with transient auditory evoked potential research that indicates the auditory brain stem and middle latency responses do not demonstrate the BMLD. The objective of the present study is to investigate the brain stem and cortical mechanisms underlying the BMLD in humans using the brain stem and cortical auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs).

DESIGN:A 500-Hz pure tone, amplitude-modulated (AM) at 80 Hz and 7 (or 13) Hz, was used to elicit brain stem and cortical ASSRs, respectively. The masker was a 200-Hz-wide noise centered on 500 Hz. Eleven adult subjects with normal hearing were tested. Both ASSR (brain stem and cortical) and behavioral thresholds for diotic AM stimuli (when the signal and noise are in phase binaurally: SoNo) and dichotic AM stimuli (when either the signal or noise is 180 degrees out-of-phase between the two ears: SpiNo, SoNpi) were investigated. ASSR and behavioral BMLDs were obtained by subtracting the threshold for the dichotic stimuli from that for the diotic stimuli, respectively. Effects for modulation rate, signal versus noise phase changes, and behavioral versus ASSR measure on the BMLD were investigated.

RESULTS:Behavioral BMLDs (mean = 8.5 to 10.5 dB) obtained are consistent with results from past research. The ASSR results are similar to the pattern of results previously found for the transient auditory brain stem responses and the N1-P2 cortical auditory evoked potential, in that only the cortical ASSRs (7 or 13 Hz) demonstrate BMLDs (mean = 5.8 dB); the brain stem ASSRs (80 Hz) (mean = 1.5 dB) do not. The ASSR results differ from the previous transient N1-P2 studies, however, in that the cortical ASSRs show a BMLD only when there is a change in the signal interaural phase, but not for changes of noise interaural phase.

CONCLUSIONS:Results suggest that brain processes underlying the BMLD occur either in a different pathway or beyond the brain stem auditory processing underlying the 80-Hz ASSR. Results also suggest that the cortical ASSRs have somewhat different neural sources than the transient N1-P2 responses, and that they may reflect the output of neural populations that previous research has shown to be insensitive to binaural differences in noise.},

abstract = {Learning to read proceeds smoothly for most children, yet others struggle to translate verbal language into its written form. Poor readers often have a host of auditory, linguistic, and attention deficits, including abnormal neural representation of speech and inconsistent performance on psychoacoustic tasks. We hypothesize that this constellation of deficits associated with reading disorders arises from the human auditory system failing to respond to sound in a consistent manner, and that this inconsistency impinges upon the ability to relate phonology and orthography during reading. In support of this hypothesis, we show that poor readers have significantly more variable auditory brainstem responses to speech than do good readers, independent of resting neurophysiological noise levels. Thus, neural variability may be an underlying biological contributor to well established behavioral and neural deficits found in poor readers.},

abstract = {1. Discharge properties of olivocochlear efferent neurons were measured in anesthetized cats. Previous studies of these neurons concentrated on monaural stimulation with tones and found sound-evoked discharge rates rarely exceeded 60 spikes/s (16, 20). In the present study, rates as high as 140 spikes/s were achieved by binaural stimulation and/or the addition of noise. Based on studies on the known effects of electrically stimulating the efferents such high rates of sound-evoked efferent activity probably have significant feedback effects on the auditory periphery. 2. Spontaneous discharge rate (SR) was weakly correlated with threshold among efferent neurons: those with SRs greater than 1 spikes/s were generally more sensitive than spontaneously inactive fibers. The discharge rate measured in the absence of acoustic stimulation was shown to be dependent on stimulation history: some units with zero SR became spontaneously active after several minutes of continuous noise stimulation. 3. For stimulation with monaural tones, efferent excitability varied with characteristic frequency (CF): units with CF less than 10 kHz tended to have lower thresholds, higher discharge rates, and shorter latencies than higher CF units. These differences could be minimized by the addition of broadband noise (see below). 4. When tones were presented to one ear at a time, most efferent units appeared monaural (91%), with roughly two-thirds excited by ipsilateral stimuli and one-third by contralateral stimuli. However, the effects of simultaneous stimulation of the two ears suggested that the great majority of efferent units have binaural inputs: the addition of opposite-ear noise or tones, which presented alone were not excitatory, typically enhanced the response to main-ear stimulation. This type of binaural facilitation was strongest among low-CF efferents when the opposite-ear stimuli were tones, and strongest among high-CF units when the opposite-ear stimulus was broadband noise. 5. The binaural facilitation seen using opposite-ear noise both lowered the threshold (by as much as 40 dB) and increased the discharge rate (by as much as 80%) to tones presented in the main ear. Significant facilitation was seen with noise levels as low as 25 dB SPL or tone levels as low as 30 dB SPL. In general, the weaker the response to monaural stimuli, the stronger the binaural facilitation. 6. The facilitatory effects of stimulation with continuous noise could outlast the stimulus. Persistent increases in efferent sensitivity were documented following 10-min exposures to broadband noise at 85-115 dB SPL.},

abstract = {This study examined the degree to which increasing the number of signal presentations provides children with a release from informational masking. Listeners were younger children (5-7 years), older children (8-10 years), and adults. Detection thresholds were measured for a sequence of repeating 50-ms bursts of a 1000-Hz pure-tone signal embedded in a sequence of 10- and 50-ms bursts of a random-frequency, two-tone masker. Masker bursts were played at an overall level of 60-dB sound pressure level in each interval of a two-interval, forced choice adaptive procedure. Performance was examined for conditions with two, four, five, and six signal bursts. Regardless of the number of signal bursts, thresholds for most children were higher than thresholds for most adults. Despite developmental effects in informational masking, however, masked threshold decreased with additional signal bursts by a similar amount for younger children, older children, and adults. The magnitude of masking release for both groups of children and for adults was inconsistent with absolute energy detection. Instead, increasing the number of signal bursts appears to aid children in the perceptual segregation of the fixed-frequency signal from the random-frequency masker as has been previously reported for adults [Kidd, G., et al. (2003). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 114, 2835-2845].},

abstract = {The dynamics of cochlear excitotoxicity can be monitored from effects on the contralateral ear. After unilateral mechanical ablation of the cochlea (in a mouse model) we observed immediate elevations in auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR) thresholds in the contralateral ear. Threshold elevations peaked at 2-3~h post ablation, and returned to baseline levels after 5-6~h. These contralateral effects are initiated by cochlear afferent injury discharges most likely activating the olivocochlear efferent system. Six hours after cochlear injury, ABR thresholds were fully returned to pre-lesion baseline levels and remained normal for up to 10 days of monitoring. We have confirmed that our cochlear ablation procedure increases short-term activity levels in the auditory brainstem and midbrain using c-fos labelling. The study provides insight into the dynamics of glutamate excitotoxicity, a pathological process directly related to acute tinnitus after acoustic trauma, and more generally implicated in many types of brain injury and neuro-degenerative disease.},

In addition to the audiogram, we measured frequency resolution, temporal resolution, and speech reception in quiet and in noise. Frequency resolution was derived from masking with comb-filtered noise and from the psychophysical tuning curve, for both paradigms in simultaneous and in nonsimultaneous masking. The critical ratio was also determined. Temporal resolution was determined with intensity-modulated noise and from backward and forward masking. All tests were performed at 1000 Hz. Correlations among tests were gathered in a matrix and subjected to a principal-components analysis. It turned out that tests on frequency resolution form a cluster, and are approximately independent of audiometric loss. Furthermore, hearing loss for speech in noise is closely allied to frequency resolution, whereas hearing loss for speech in quiet is governed by audiometric loss.},

abstract = {There are powerful pathways descending from the auditory cortex (AC) to the inferior colliculus (IC), yet their function is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a reversible cortical inactivation, achieved by cooling of the AC, on the responses of neurons in the rat IC. Extracellular single-unit or multi-unit activity was recorded in the IC of anaesthetized rats with a 16-channel multielectrode probe introduced along the IC dorso-ventral axis through the dorsal cortex (DCIC) to the central nucleus of the IC (CIC). Cooling of the AC produced an increase in spontaneous activity and magnitude of the sound-evoked response in 47% of the IC neurons. Maximal changes in the neuronal activity were observed in the DCIC and the central part of the CIC. The final segments of the sustained responses to 60~ms stimuli and the off responses were more affected than the onset segments. Inactivation of the AC resulted in a suppression of the post-excitatory inhibition and neuronal adaptation, which was reflected in a pronounced enhancement of synchronized responses to a series of fast repeated clicks. The response parameters recovered, at least partly, to the pre-cooling levels 1~h after the cooling cessation. The frequency tuning properties of the IC neurons did not show any significant changes during the cooling period. The results demonstrate that AC cooling inactivates excitatory corticofugal pathways and results in a less activated intrinsic inhibitory network in the IC.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:This article provides a critical overview of problem-based learning (PBL), its effectiveness for knowledge acquisition and clinical performance, and the underlying educational theory. The focus of the paper is on (1) the credibility of claims (both empirical and theoretical) about the ties between PBL and educational outcomes and (2) the magnitude of the effects.

METHOD:The author reviewed the medical education literature, starting with three reviews published in 1993 and moving on to research published from 1992 through 1998 in the primary sources for research in medical education. For each study the author wrote a summary, which included study design, outcome measures, effect sizes, and any other information relevant to the research conclusion.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:The review of the literature revealed no convincing evidence that PBL improves knowledge base and clinical performance, at least not of the magnitude that would be expected given the resources required for a PBL curriculum. The results were considered in light of the educational theory that underlies PBL and its basic research. The author concludes that the ties between educational theory and research (both basic and applied) are loose at best.},

abstract = {To study the functional development of the medial olivocochlear system, transient-evoked otoacoustic emission suppression experiments were conducted in 73 ears of 38 pre-term and 11 full-term neonates. The continuous contralateral stimulation was a broad band white noise, presented at 70 dB SPL. Efferent suppression was determined by subtracting the without-contralateral stimulation condition from the with-contralateral stimulation condition. Across this population, a mean suppression effect of contralateral stimulation on transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions was found, with most of the suppression effect observed after 8 ms. The amount of suppression is linearly, positively correlated with the conceptional age. In the subgroup of bilaterally tested neonates, the suppression of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions is similar in the right ear and the left ear in subjects whose conceptional age is less than 36 weeks and significantly higher in the right ear than in the left ear in older neonates. This last observation was seen at frequencies where transient-evoked otoacoustic emission amplitudes became higher in the right ear than in the left ear as the conceptional age increased, a finding already reported in adults. This study shows that the functional adult pattern of the medial efferent system, probably involved in the detection of signals in noise such as speech sounds, seems to appear gradually in neonates and represents one of the several arguments in favor of functional auditory lateralization in humans, with a right ear advantage.},

TEOAEs were analyzed into octave or one-third octave bands for frequencies ranging from 500 to 4000 Hz. Decision theory was used to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each of three measurements (OAE amplitude, OAE/noise, reproducibility) for each OAE measure (octave TEOAEs, 1/3 octave TEOAEs, DPOAEs), for octave frequencies from 500 to 4000 Hz, and for seven audiometric criteria ranging from 10 to 40 dB HL. At 500 Hz, TEOAEs and DPOAEs were unable to separate normal from impaired ears. At 1000 Hz, both TEOAE measures were more accurate in identifying hearing status than DPOAEs. At 2000 Hz, all OAE measures performed equally well. At 4000 Hz, DPOAEs were better able to distinguish normal from impaired ears. Almost without exception, measurements of OAE/noise and reproducibility performed comparably and were superior to measurements of OAE amplitude, although the differences were small. TEOAEs analyzed into octave bands showed better performance than TEOAEs analyzed into 1/3 octaves. Under standard test conditions, OAE test performance appears to be limited by background noise, especially for the low frequencies.},

abstract = {A consistent relationship between reflection-emission delay and cochlear tuning has been demonstrated in a variety of mammalian species, as predicted by filter theory and models of otoacoustic emission (OAE) generation. As a step toward the goal of studying cochlear tuning throughout the human lifespan, this paper exploits the relationship and explores two strategies for estimating delay trends-energy weighting and peak picking-both of which emphasize data at the peaks of the magnitude fine structure. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 2f1-f2 were recorded, and their reflection components were extracted in 184 subjects ranging in age from prematurely born neonates to elderly adults. DPOAEs were measured from 0.5-4 kHz in all age groups and extended to 8 kHz in young adults. Delay trends were effectively estimated using either energy weighting or peak picking, with the former method yielding slightly shorter delays and the latter somewhat smaller confidence intervals. Delay and tuning estimates from young adults roughly match those obtained from SFOAEs. Although the match is imperfect, reflection-component delays showed the expected bend (apical-basal transition) near 1 kHz, consistent with a break in cochlear scaling. Consistent with other measures of tuning, the term newborn group showed the longest delays and sharpest tuning over much of the frequency range.},

abstract = {Recent studies lead to the conclusion that focused attention, through the activity of corticofugal and medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent pathways, modulates activity at the most peripheral aspects of the auditory system within the cochlea. In two experiments, we investigated the effects of different intermodal attention manipulations on the response of outer hair cells (OHCs), and the control exerted by the MOC efferent system. The effect of the MOCs on OHC activity was characterized by measuring the amplitude and rapid adaptation time course of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). In the first, DPOAE recordings were compared while participants were reading a book and counting the occurrence of the letter "a" (auditory-ignoring) and while counting either short- or long-duration eliciting tones (auditory-attending). In the second, DPOAEs were recorded while subjects watched muted movies with subtitles (auditory-ignoring/visual distraction) and were compared with DPOAEs recorded while subjects counted the same tones (auditory-attending) as in Experiment 1. In both Experiments 1 and 2, the absolute level of the averaged DPOAEs recorded during the auditory-ignoring condition was statistically higher than that recorded in the auditory-attending condition. Efferent-induced rapid adaptation was evident in all DPOAE contours, under all attention conditions, suggesting that two medial efferent processes act independently to determine rapid adaptation, which is unaffected by attention, and the overall DPOAE level, which is significantly affected by changes in the focus of attention.},

abstract = {Deficits in phonological skills appear to be at the heart of reading disability; however, the nature of this impairment is not yet known. The hypothesis that dyslexic subjects are impaired in auditory frequency discrimination was tested by using an attention-independent auditory brain potential, termed mismatch negativity (MMN) while subjects performed a visual distractor task. In separate blocks, MMN responses to graded changes in tone frequency or tone duration were recorded in 10 dyslexic and matched control subjects. MMN potentials to changes in tone frequency but not to changes in tone duration were abnormal in dyslexic subjects. This physiological deficit was corroborated by a similarly specific impairment in discriminating tone frequency, but not tone duration, which was assessed separately. Furthermore, the pitch discrimination and MMN deficit was correlated with the degree of impairment in phonological skills, as reflected in reading errors of regular words and nonwords. It is possible that in dyslexia a persistent sensory deficit in monitoring the frequency of incoming sound may impair the feedback control necessary for the normal development of phonological skills.},

abstract = {A nonlinear version of the stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emission (SFOAE) was measured using stimulus waveforms similar to those used for behavioral overshoot. Behaviorally, the seven listeners were as much as 11 dB worse at detecting a brief tonal signal (4.0 kHz, 10 ms in duration) when it occurred soon after the onset of a wideband masking noise (0.1-6.0 kHz; 400 ms in duration) than when it was delayed by about 200 ms, and the nonlinear SFOAE measure exhibited a similar effect. When either lowpass (0.1-3.8 kHz) or bandpass noise (3.8-4.2 kHz) was used instead of the wideband noise, the physiological and behavioral measures again were similar. When a highpass noise (4.2-6.0 kHz) was used, the physiological and behavioral measures both showed no overshoot-like effect for five of the subjects. The physiological response to the tone decayed slowly after the termination of the noise, much like the time course of resetting for behavioral overshoot. One subject exhibited no overshoot behaviorally even though his cochlear responses were like those of the other subjects. Overall, the evidence suggests that some basic characteristics of overshoot are obligatory consequences of cochlear function, as modulated by the olivocochlear efferent system.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:This article summarizes the results of a multi-center study, "Identification of Neonatal Hearing Impairment," sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The purpose of this study was to determine the performance characteristics of three measures of peripheral auditory system status, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brain stem responses (ABR), applied in the neonatal period in predicting hearing status at 8 to 12 mo corrected age.

DESIGN:The design and implementation of this study are described in the first two articles in this series. Seven institutions participated in this study; 7179 infants were evaluated. Graduates of the neonatal intensive care unit and well babies with one or more risk factors for hearing loss were targeted for follow-up testing using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. Neonatal test performance was evaluated using the VRA data as the "gold standard."

RESULTS:The major results of the study are described in the nine articles preceding this summary article. TEOAEs in response to an 80 dB pSPL click, DPOAEs in response to L1 = 65 and L2 = 50 dB SPL and ABR in response to a 30 dB nHL click performed well as predictors of permanent hearing loss of 30 dB or greater at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. All measures were robust with respect to infant state, test environment and infant medical status. No test performed perfectly.

CONCLUSIONS:Based on the data from this study, the 1993 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference-recommended protocol-an OAE test followed by an ABR test for those infants failing the OAE test-would result in low referral rate (96 to 98%). TEOAEs for 80 dB pSPL, ABR for 30 dB nHL and DPOAEs for L1 = 65 dB SPL and L2 = 50 dB SPL perform well in predicting hearing status based on the area under the relative operating characteristic curve. Accuracy for the OAE measurements are best when the speech awareness threshold or the pure-tone average for 2.0 kHz and 4 kHz are used as the gold standard. ABR accuracy varies little as a function of the frequencies included in the gold standard. In addition, 96% of those infants returning for VRA at 8 to 12 mo corrected age were able to provide reliable ear-specific behavioral thresholds using insert earphones and a rigorous psychophysical VRA protocol.},

abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:An increased interest in Central Auditory Processing Disorder has seen the publication of several guidelines to help inform clinical practice. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic search and critically evaluate published guidelines to inform the ongoing development of evidence-based practice in this area.

METHOD:A systematic search of the literature was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Nominated guidelines were then critiqued using the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool.

RESULTS:Five clinical practice guidelines in the area of Central Auditory Processing Disorder were identified. The British Society of Audiology guideline achieved the highest rating for scope and purpose, rigour of development and applicability and overall score.

CONCLUSIONS:The AGREE II tool is an effective way to critically evaluate the quality of methodological reporting of clinical practice guidelines in the area of Central Auditory Processing Disorder and provides direction for the ongoing development of these guidelines in the future.},

abstract = {The main goal of the present study was to investigate the encoding of a biologically-relevant acoustic feature--amplitude modulation (AM)--in single neurons of the auditory nerve and ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). In the anesthetized gerbil auditory-nerve fibers and VCN units show strong synchronous responses to low-intensity, low-frequency AM. As frequency increases, the strength of the synchronous response decreases. In the auditory nerve the strength of the synchronous response is substantially less at high intensities than at low intensities and does not change significantly with AM frequency at high intensities. In contrast to the auditory nerve, VCN units show strong responses at high intensities. They have a particular AM frequency to which they are maximally responsive, and this frequency varies from unit to unit. Therefore, VCN units transform their ascending inputs by enhancing the synchronous response to AM. A correlation exists between a unit's ability to encode AM and its responses to simple sounds. Specifically, onset units show the strongest synchronous responses, followed in order by chopper, primarylike-with-notch and primarylike units. This enhancement is greatest at high intensities and can occur up to 90 dB above a unit's threshold. Thus, a hierarchy of enhancement for AM processing exists in the most peripheral nucleus of the central auditory system.},

abstract = {Even in the quietest of rooms, our senses are perpetually inundated by a barrage of sounds, requiring the auditory system to adapt to a variety of listening conditions in order to extract signals of interest (e.g., one speaker's voice amidst others). Brain networks that promote selective attention are thought to sharpen the neural encoding of a target signal, suppressing competing sounds and enhancing perceptual performance. Here, we ask: does musical training benefit cortical mechanisms that underlie selective attention to speech? To answer this question, we assessed the impact of selective auditory attention on cortical auditory-evoked response variability in musicians and non-musicians. Outcomes indicate strengthened brain networks for selective auditory attention in musicians in that musicians but not non-musicians demonstrate decreased prefrontal response variability with auditory attention. Results are interpreted in the context of previous work documenting perceptual and subcortical advantages in musicians for the hearing and neural encoding of speech in background noise. Musicians' neural proficiency for selectively engaging and sustaining auditory attention to language indicates a potential benefit of music for auditory training. Given the importance of auditory attention for the development and maintenance of language-related skills, musical training may aid in the prevention, habilitation, and remediation of individuals with a wide range of attention-based language, listening and learning impairments.},

This paper describes a study on the possible merits of such a display for bandlimited speech with respect to intelligibility and talker recognition against a background of competing voices. Different conditions were investigated: speech material (words/sentences), presentation mode (monaural/binaural/3D), number of competing talkers (1-4), and virtual position of the talkers (in 45 degrees-steps around the front horizontal plane). Average results for 12 listeners show an increase of speech intelligibility for 3D presentation for two or more competing talkers compared to conventional binaural presentation. The ability to recognize a talker is slightly better and the time required for recognition is significantly shorter for 3D presentation in the presence of two or three competing talkers. Although absolute localization of a talker is rather poor, spatial separation appears to have a significant effect on communication. For either speech intelligibility, talker recognition, or localization, no difference is found between the use of an individualized 3D auditory display and a general display.},

abstract = {The effects of classroom noise and background speech on speech perception, measured by word-to-picture matching, and listening comprehension, measured by execution of oral instructions, were assessed in first- and third-grade children and adults in a classroom-like setting. For speech perception, in addition to noise, reverberation time (RT) was varied by conducting the experiment in two virtual classrooms with mean RT = 0.47 versus RT = 1.1 s. Children were more impaired than adults by background sounds in both speech perception and listening comprehension. Classroom noise evoked a reliable disruption in children's speech perception even under conditions of short reverberation. RT had no effect on speech perception in silence, but evoked a severe increase in the impairments due to background sounds in all age groups. For listening comprehension, impairments due to background sounds were found in the children, stronger for first- than for third-graders, whereas adults were unaffected. Compared to classroom noise, background speech had a smaller effect on speech perception, but a stronger effect on listening comprehension, remaining significant when speech perception was controlled. This indicates that background speech affects higher-order cognitive processes involved in children's comprehension. Children's ratings of the sound-induced disturbance were low overall and uncorrelated to the actual disruption, indicating that the children did not consciously realize the detrimental effects. The present results confirm earlier findings on the substantial impact of noise and reverberation on children's speech perception, and extend these to classroom-like environmental settings and listening demands closely resembling those faced by children at school.},

abstract = {Electromotile activity in auditory outer hair cells (OHCs) is essential for sound amplification. It relies on the highly specialized membrane motor protein prestin, and its interactions with the cytoskeleton. It is believed that the expression of prestin and related molecules involved in OHC electromotility may be dynamically regulated by signals from the acoustic environment. However little is known about the nature of such signals and how they affect the expression of molecules involved in electromotility in OHCs. We show evidence that prestin oligomerization is regulated, both at short and relatively long term, by acoustic input and descending efferent activity originating in the cortex, likely acting in concert. Unilateral removal of the middle ear ossicular chain reduces levels of trimeric prestin, particularly in the cochlea from the side of the lesion, whereas monomeric and dimeric forms are maintained or even increased in particular in the contralateral side, as shown in Western blots. Unilateral removal of the auditory cortex (AC), which likely causes an imbalance in descending efferent activity on the cochlea, also reduces levels of trimeric and tetrameric forms of prestin in the side ipsilateral to the lesion, whereas in the contralateral side prestin remains unaffected, or even increased in the case of trimeric and tetrameric forms. As far as efferent inputs are concerned, unilateral ablation of the AC up-regulates the expression of $\alpha$10 nicotinic Ach receptor (nAChR) transcripts in the cochlea, as shown by RT-Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). This suggests that homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms may be involved in dynamically regulating OHC electromotility by medial olivocochlear efferents. Limited, unbalanced efferent activity after unilateral AC removal, also affects prestin and $\beta$-actin mRNA levels. These findings support that the concerted action of acoustic and efferent inputs to the cochlea is needed to regulate the expression of major molecules involved in OHC electromotility, both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.},

abstract = {It is well established that low-level broad band noise can elicit an amplitude decrease in evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded in the opposite ear. However, the influence of the temporal characteristics of the contralateral stimulus on this effect remains largely unknown. In the present study, otoacoustic emissions evoked by 60 dB SPL clicks were recorded in 19 normal-hearing subjects using the Otodynamics IL088, successively in absence and presence of a contralateral noise that was either steady or modulated sinusoidally in amplitude at different depths (from 25% to 100% in 25 point steps) and rates (from 50 Hz to 800 Hz in half-octave steps). The energy was kept constant whatever the modulation depth. The results showed that the evoked otoacoustic-emission attenuation effect induced by contralateral stimulation varied depending on the modulation depth and frequency of the contralateral amplitude-modulated noise. The largest suppression effect was observed at the 100 Hz modulation frequency and the 100% modulation depth. The 50 Hz modulation resulted in less suppression than with unmodulated noise. An interpretation of these results in terms of the influence of temporal amplitude fluctuations falling within a certain range on medial olivocochlear bundle activity is discussed.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning can be defined as practice-induced improvement in the ability to perform specific perceptual tasks. We previously proposed the Reverse Hierarchy Theory as a unifying concept that links behavioral findings of visual learning with physiological and anatomical data. Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

abstract = {In the mammalian cochlea, the two types of hair cells drastically differ in their anatomy and physiology. Each system receives a specific efferent control originating in the brainstem superior olivary complex. Inner hair cells are connected to the afferent type I ganglion neurons (comprising 95% of the auditory nerve) which postsynaptically receive the input of the lateral efferents. On the other hand, outer hair cells, whose electromotile properties are responsible for the active mechanism, are directly under medial efferent control. Neurochemically, both types of efferents are also well distinguished. The present paper reviews the efferent neurochemistry and pharmacology, with an emphasis on the protective roles of each system on cochlear function. The role of lateral efferent neurotransmitters such as enkephalins and dopamine in protecting the auditory nerve dendrites against excessive noise and/or excitotoxicity is especially addressed. The cholinergic medial efferents synapsing with the outer hair cells play a role in altering and/or modulating cochlear micromechanics. They could also be involved in a potentiating effect on aminoglycoside ototoxicity.},

abstract = {Recent studies lead to the conclusion that focused attention, through the activity of corticofugal and medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent pathways, modulates activity at the most peripheral aspects of the auditory system within the cochlea. In two experiments, we investigated the effects of different intermodal attention manipulations on the response of outer hair cells (OHCs), and the control exerted by the MOC efferent system. The effect of the MOCs on OHC activity was characterized by measuring the amplitude and rapid adaptation time course of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). In the first, DPOAE recordings were compared while participants were reading a book and counting the occurrence of the letter "a" (auditory-ignoring) and while counting either short- or long-duration eliciting tones (auditory-attending). In the second, DPOAEs were recorded while subjects watched muted movies with subtitles (auditory-ignoring/visual distraction) and were compared with DPOAEs recorded while subjects counted the same tones (auditory-attending) as in Experiment 1. In both Experiments 1 and 2, the absolute level of the averaged DPOAEs recorded during the auditory-ignoring condition was statistically higher than that recorded in the auditory-attending condition. Efferent-induced rapid adaptation was evident in all DPOAE contours, under all attention conditions, suggesting that two medial efferent processes act independently to determine rapid adaptation, which is unaffected by attention, and the overall DPOAE level, which is significantly affected by changes in the focus of attention.},

abstract = {CONCLUSION:According to the presented data, speech-in-noise intelligibility (SI) does not correlate with olivocochlear efferent activity - as measured by contralateral suppression (CS) of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) in humans with normal auditory threshold.

OBJECTIVES:Literature data indicate a possible role of the medial olivocochlear efferents in speech intelligibility, especially in background noise. The objective of this study was to investigate this relationship.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:SI was evaluated in three independent sessions by determining the ratio speech level/noise level, at which 50% of the words are understood (i.e. speech reception threshold, SRT). Efferent activity was inferred measuring CS of DPOAE, using two different paradigms with extensive variation of stimulus parameters and duplicate measurements.

RESULTS:For optimum measurement of CS, the study was restricted to subjects (n =49) with valid DPOAE down to primary tone levels L1=47/L2 =20 dB SPL. Average SRT was -6.66 dB (-4.50 to -7.65 dB, SD 0.63 dB). CS increased with decreasing primary tone levels, with mean absolute CS values in the range of 0.6-6 dB SPL. Test-retest repeatability was good. Statistical evaluation revealed no significant relationship between SI and CS of DPOAE.},

abstract = {The ability to extract a pitch from complex harmonic sounds, such as human speech, animal vocalizations, and musical instruments, is a fundamental attribute of hearing. Some theories of pitch rely on the frequency-to-place mapping, or tonotopy, in the inner ear (cochlea), but most current models are based solely on the relative timing of spikes in the auditory nerve. So far, it has proved to be difficult to distinguish between these two possible representations, primarily because temporal and place information usually covary in the cochlea. In this study, "transposed stimuli" were used to dissociate temporal from place information. By presenting the temporal information of low-frequency sinusoids to locations in the cochlea tuned to high frequencies, we found that human subjects displayed poor pitch perception for single tones. More importantly, none of the subjects was able to extract the fundamental frequency from multiple low-frequency harmonics presented to high-frequency regions of the cochlea. The experiments demonstrate that tonotopic representation is crucial to complex pitch perception and provide a new tool in the search for the neural basis of pitch.},

abstract = {This article reviews available clinical and psychophysical data concerning the effects of multiple sclerosis (MS) on basic auditory processes. On the basis of the data, it is suggested that the presence of auditory deficits should be sought in MS patients. This is especially important in light of recent psychophysical evidence suggesting that subtle auditory problems present in affected individuals may not always be detectable via conventional clinical testing. These data also provide an alternate means of interpreting various aspects of impaired auditory functioning in MS patients, and aid in generating new hypotheses regarding the possible consequences of demyelination on normal auditory perception. Finally, new ways of testing such hypotheses are proposed, and possible directions for future research are suggested.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Studies exploring neurophysiological correlates of main psychiatric disorders have commonly used event-related potentials (ERP) during a visual or an auditory oddball task. The main results concern modulations of the P3b amplitude and/or latency. The present study aims to increase the clinical sensitivity of these P3b modulations by using a more ecological oddball design, using synchronized pairs of audio-visual emotional stimuli.

METHOD:Two groups of healthy participants, one composed of controls and the other of students displaying anxious and depressive tendencies completed visual, auditory and audio-visual (cross-modal) oddball tasks, in which they had to detect deviant happy and sad stimuli among neutral ones as quickly as possible. Behavioral performance and P3b ERP data were analyzed.

RESULTS:Subjects displaying anxious and depressive tendencies exhibited lower P3b amplitude than the controls, but only in the cross-modal oddball task.

CONCLUSIONS:Although the two groups of subjects differed in their levels of co-morbid anxiety and depression, unimodal visual and auditory oddball tasks did not allow us to detect this difference by P3b amplitude modulations, but the cross-modal task did.

SIGNIFICANCE:These results suggest that a cross-modal oddball design should be used in future studies to increase the sensitivity of the P300 amplitude differences between healthy participants and those with clinical symptoms.},

Temporal envelopes of speech were extracted from broad frequency bands and were used to modulate noises of the same bandwidths. This manipulation preserved temporal envelope cues in each band but restricted the listener to severely degraded information on the distribution of spectral energy. The identification of consonants, vowels, and words in simple sentences improved markedly as the number of bands increased; high speech recognition performance was obtained with only three bands of modulated noise. Thus, the presentation of a dynamic temporal pattern in only a few broad spectral regions is sufficient for the recognition of speech.},

McFarland (2005) define central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) as a "modality-specific perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss" and that "should be distinguishable from cognitive, language-based, and/or supramodal attentional problems" (p. 113). Although agreeing with the general thrust of their attempts to exclude supramodal causes of impaired auditory performance as being labeled CAPD, I argue that this definition suffers from a number of serious deficiencies. It is both too loose and too restrictive, excluding what might be low-level deficits that occur in more than one modality, at the same time including at least one form of modality-specific linguistic processing. I argue that any useful definition of CAPD must not only exclude supramodal causes of auditory deficits, but must be based on the notion of impaired brain function demonstrable for nonspeech sounds.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) are reflections of cochlear energy produced during the processing of sound. The suppression effect identified as the decrease with the additional tone stimulator of the otoacoustic emission amplitude is use for assessing efferent auditory system function. The aim of this study is to investigate the contralateral suppression effect (CSE) of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) in children with auditory listening problems (ALPs) compared to normal hearing children.

METHOD:The study group (Group 1) was consisted of 12 ALP children (8 males and 4 females), aged 5-10 years, and associated with receptive and expressive language delay. The control group was consisted of (Group 2) 12 children with normal hearing levels, matched according to gender and age of TEOAEs and CSE of TEOAEs were investigated at 1.0-4.0 kHz in both groups.

RESULTS:For right ear, at 1.0 and 3.0 kHz, TEOAE amplitudes of the ALP group were significantly lower than the control group. At 2.0, 4.0 and 5.0 kHz of the right ear and at 1.0-5.0 kHz of the left ear, TEOAE amplitudes were found as not different between ALP and control groups. Suppression values of the ALP group were significantly lower than the control group at 1.0-2.0 kHz of the right ear and at 2.0 kHz of the left ear. At the other frequencies, there was no significant difference between the suppression values of the ALP and control groups.

CONCLUSION:Lower suppression values in ALP group at all frequencies (significant at 1.0-2.0 and 2.0 kHz in the right and left ears, respectively) showed that cochlear and cranial maturation of the ALP group may lower than the control group. Since the age profile in both group is similar, we thought that age's effect on this results is not important. Our results showed that children with ALP have auditory processing difficulties in noisy environment. For understanding the efferent auditory system, patients with auditory processing disorders may be evaluated by the help of background noise.},

abstract = {In transmission-line models of cochlear mechanics, predictions about otoacoustic-emission delays depend on the place- or wave-fixed nature of the emission generation mechanism. In this work, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), recorded at different stimulus levels in 10 young subjects, were analyzed using wavelet-based time-frequency analysis to determine the latency of each frequency component of the response. The same wave forms were Fourier analyzed to evaluate the phase-gradient delay as a function of frequency. Interpreting the relation between these two characteristic delays using cochlear models shows that most of the TEOAE response can be attributed to place-fixed reflection mechanisms. The causality principle explains observed correlations between fluctuations of the TEOAE amplitude and phase-gradient delay.},

abstract = {Recent anatomical and electrophysiological evidence in primates indicates the presence of direct connections between primary auditory and primary visual cortex that constitute cross-modal systems. We examined the intrinsic functional connectivity (fcMRI) of putative primary auditory cortex in 32 young adults during resting state scanning. We found that the medial Heschl's gyrus was strongly coupled, in particular, to visual cortex along the anterior banks of the calcarine fissure. This observation was confirmed using novel group-level, tensor-based independent components analysis. fcMRI analysis revealed that although overall coupling between the auditory and visual cortex was significantly reduced when subjects performed a visual perception task, coupling between the anterior calcarine cortex and auditory cortex was not disrupted. These results suggest that primary auditory cortex has a functionally distinct relationship with the anterior visual cortex, which is known to represent the peripheral visual field. Our study provides novel, fcMRI-based, support for a neural system involving low-level auditory and visual cortices.},

abstract = {Cochlear activity is regulated by the olivo-cochlear bundle, which originates from the brainstem and projects onto the hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. Two efferent components can be distinguished: the medial and lateral olivo-cochlear efferent originating from the medial, and the lateral nuclei of the superior olivary complex. The input of the efferent systems on hair cells occurs during development and persists in the adult cochlea. Recent studies have shown that the efferent innervations are required to set the activity pattern in developing hair cells and auditory nerve fibers and to protect the synaptic structures in adult cochlea. In addition, efferent innervations undergo plasticity during pathological conditions such as noise-trauma or aging. This review discusses the mechanisms underlying the control of the hair cells and afferent fibers excitability by efferent neurons and their putative role in developing adult and pathological conditions.},

This MOC-induced decrease in the gain of the cochlear amplifier is reflected in changes in OAEs. Any OAE can be used to monitor MOC effects on the cochlear amplifier. Each OAE type has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most straightforward technique for monitoring MOC effects is to elicit MOC activity with an elicitor sound contralateral to the OAE test ear. MOC effects can also be monitored using an ipsilateral elicitor of MOC activity, but the ipsilateral elicitor brings additional problems caused by suppression and cochlear slow intrinsic effects. To measure MOC effects accurately, one must ensure that there are no middle-ear-muscle contractions. Although standard clinical middle-ear-muscle tests are not adequate for this, adequate tests can usually be done with OAE-measuring instruments. An additional complication is that most probe sounds also elicit MOC activity, although this does not prevent the probe from showing MOC effects elicited by contralateral sound. A variety of data indicate that MOC efferents help to reduce acoustic trauma and lessen the masking of transients by background noise; for instance, they aid in speech comprehension in noise. However, much remains to be learned about the role of efferents in auditory function. Monitoring MOC effects in humans using OAEs should continue to provide valuable insights into the role of MOC efferents and may also provide clinical benefits.},

abstract = {Children as young as 5 yr old localize sounds as accurately as adults in quiet in the frontal hemifield. However, children's ability to localize in noise and in the front/back (F/B) dimension are scantily studied. To address this, the first part of this study investigated localization-in-noise ability of children vs young adults in two maskers: broadband noise (BBN) and speech-babble (SB) at three signal-to-noise ratios: -12, -6, and 0 dB. In the second part, relationship between binaural medial olivocochlear system (MOC) function and localization-in-noise was investigated. In both studies, 21 children and 21 young adults participated. Results indicate, while children are able to differentiate sounds arriving in the F/B dimension on par with adults in quiet and in BBN, larger differences were found for SB. Accuracy of children's localization in noise (for both maskers) in the lateral plane was also poorer than adults'. Significant differences in binaural MOC interaction (mBIC; the difference between the sum of two monaural- and binaural-MOC strength) between adults and children were also found. For reasons which are not clear, adult F/B localization in BBN correlates better with mBIC while children's F/B localization in SB correlated better with binaural MOC strength.},

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, and delta responses to events are, just as the gamma band, strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in functional communication in the brain in relation to memory and integrative functions.},

abstract = {Synapses between cochlear nerve terminals and hair cells are the most vulnerable elements in the inner ear in both noise-induced and age-related hearing loss, and this neuropathy is exacerbated in the absence of efferent feedback from the olivocochlear bundle. If age-related loss is dominated by a lifetime of exposure to environmental sounds, reduction of acoustic drive to the inner ear might improve cochlear preservation throughout life. To test this, we removed the tympanic membrane unilaterally in one group of young adult mice, removed the olivocochlear bundle in another group and compared their cochlear function and innervation to age-matched controls one year later. Results showed that tympanic membrane removal, and the associated threshold elevation, was counterproductive: cochlear efferent innervation was dramatically reduced, especially the lateral olivocochlear terminals to the inner hair cell area, and there was a corresponding reduction in the number of cochlear nerve synapses. This loss led to a decrease in the amplitude of the suprathreshold cochlear neural responses. Similar results were seen in two cases with conductive hearing loss due to chronic otitis media. Outer hair cell death was increased only in ears lacking medial olivocochlear innervation following olivocochlear bundle cuts. Results suggest the novel ideas that 1) the olivocochlear efferent pathway has a dramatic use-dependent plasticity even in the adult ear and 2) a component of the lingering auditory processing disorder seen in humans after persistent middle-ear infections is cochlear in origin.},

abstract = {This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the methodological approach to collecting and analyzing auditory brain stem responses to complex sounds (cABRs). cABRs provide a window into how behaviorally relevant sounds such as speech and music are processed in the brain. Because temporal and spectral characteristics of sounds are preserved in this subcortical response, cABRs can be used to assess specific impairments and enhancements in auditory processing. Notably, subcortical auditory function is neither passive nor hardwired but dynamically interacts with higher-level cognitive processes to refine how sounds are transcribed into neural code. This experience-dependent plasticity, which can occur on a number of time scales (e.g., life-long experience with speech or music, short-term auditory training, on-line auditory processing), helps shape sensory perception. Thus, by being an objective and noninvasive means for examining cognitive function and experience-dependent processes in sensory activity, cABRs have considerable utility in the study of populations where auditory function is of interest (e.g., auditory experts such as musicians, and persons with hearing loss, auditory processing, and language disorders). This tutorial is intended for clinicians and researchers seeking to integrate cABRs into their clinical or research programs.},

abstract = {1. Listeners use direction-dependent spectral cues introduced by the torso, head, and pinnae to localize the source of a sound in space. Among the prominent direction-dependent spectral features in the free field-to-eardrum transfer function are narrow regions of low acoustic energy referred to as spectral notches. In this paper, we studied the sensitivity of single auditory nerve fibers in the barbiturate-anesthetized cat to broadband noise that had been filtered by a function whose shape approximated natural notches in the free field-to-eardrum transfer function. 2. Two experimental paradigms were employed. The first was the repeated presentation of a burst of broadband noise filtered by the simulated-notch function. Center frequency of the notch was held constant at or around the fiber characteristic frequency (CF). We refer to this as a "stationary" notch stimulus. The second paradigm was the repeated presentation of a broadband noise that was constructed from noise segments, each filtered by the simulated notch, whose CF was incremented and then decremented in a systematic way. We refer to this as a "moving" notch stimulus. Results from these two paradigms were compared with respect to notch detection. 3. Data were obtained from 161 single auditory nerve fibers having CFs ranging from 0.4 to 40 kHz. Most fibers studied had CFs > 5 kHz, and they detected the presence of the spectral notch in an intensity- and frequency-dependent manner. Each fiber responded vigorously to the presence of broadband noise. When the CF of the notch encroached on the response area of the fiber, there was a demonstrable reduction in discharge rate. The greatest reduction in discharge rate occurred when the notch was centered at the fiber's CF and when the level of the notch signal was some 15-55 dB above the fiber's noise threshold. There was close association in the frequency-intensity plane between the position of the most effective notch and the fiber's threshold tuning curve. 4. For high-spontaneous rate fibers, a moving-notch stimulus, but not a stationary one, reduced the discharge below the spontaneous rate at and in the immediate vicinity of the most effective notch frequency. This increases sensitivity to a spectral notch and suggests a mechanism by which localization ability is enhanced when there is relative motion between a sound source and the head.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:Using a continuous listening task, we evaluated the coupling between the listener's cortical activity and the temporal envelopes of different sounds in a multitalker auditory scene using magnetoencephalography and corticovocal coherence analysis. Neuromagnetic signals were recorded from 20 right-handed healthy adult humans who listened to five different recorded stories (attended speech streams), one without any multitalker background (No noise) and four mixed with a "cocktail party" multitalker background noise at four signal-to-noise ratios (5, 0, -5, and -10 dB) to produce speech-in-noise mixtures, here referred to as Global scene. Coherence analysis revealed that the modulations of the attended speech stream, presented without multitalker background, were coupled at ∼0.5 Hz to the activity of both superior temporal gyri, whereas the modulations at 4-8 Hz were coupled to the activity of the right supratemporal auditory cortex. In cocktail party conditions, with the multitalker background noise, the coupling was at both frequencies stronger for the attended speech stream than for the unattended Multitalker background. The coupling strengths decreased as the Multitalker background increased. During the cocktail party conditions, the ∼0.5 Hz coupling became left-hemisphere dominant, compared with bilateral coupling without the multitalker background, whereas the 4-8 Hz coupling remained right-hemisphere lateralized in both conditions. The brain activity was not coupled to the multitalker background or to its individual talkers. The results highlight the key role of listener's left superior temporal gyri in extracting the slow ∼0.5 Hz modulations, likely reflecting the attended speech stream within a multitalker auditory scene.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:When people listen to one person in a "cocktail party," their auditory cortex mainly follows the attended speech stream rather than the entire auditory scene. However, how the brain extracts the attended speech stream from the whole auditory scene and how increasing background noise corrupts this process is still debated. In this magnetoencephalography study, subjects had to attend a speech stream with or without multitalker background noise. Results argue for frequency-dependent cortical tracking mechanisms for the attended speech stream. The left superior temporal gyrus tracked the ∼0.5 Hz modulations of the attended speech stream only when the speech was embedded in multitalker background, whereas the right supratemporal auditory cortex tracked 4-8 Hz modulations during both noiseless and cocktail-party conditions.},

abstract = {How can we concentrate on relevant sounds in noisy environments? A "gain model" suggests that auditory attention simply amplifies relevant and suppresses irrelevant afferent inputs. However, it is unclear whether this suffices when attended and ignored features overlap to stimulate the same neuronal receptive fields. A "tuning model" suggests that, in addition to gain, attention modulates feature selectivity of auditory neurons. We recorded magnetoencephalography, EEG, and functional MRI (fMRI) while subjects attended to tones delivered to one ear and ignored opposite-ear inputs. The attended ear was switched every 30 s to quantify how quickly the effects evolve. To produce overlapping inputs, the tones were presented alone vs. during white-noise masking notch-filtered {\textpm}1/6 octaves around the tone center frequencies. Amplitude modulation (39 vs. 41 Hz in opposite ears) was applied for "frequency tagging" of attention effects on maskers. Noise masking reduced early (50-150 ms; N1) auditory responses to unattended tones. In support of the tuning model, selective attention canceled out this attenuating effect but did not modulate the gain of 50-150 ms activity to nonmasked tones or steady-state responses to the maskers themselves. These tuning effects originated at nonprimary auditory cortices, purportedly occupied by neurons that, without attention, have wider frequency tuning than {\textpm}1/6 octaves. The attentional tuning evolved rapidly, during the first few seconds after attention switching, and correlated with behavioral discrimination performance. In conclusion, a simple gain model alone cannot explain auditory selective attention. In nonprimary auditory cortices, attention-driven short-term plasticity retunes neurons to segregate relevant sounds from noise.},

abstract = {Although usually assumed to be smooth and continuous, mammalian cochlear frequency-position maps are predicted to manifest a staircase-like structure comprising plateaus of nearly constant characteristic frequency separated by abrupt discontinuities. The height and width of the stair steps are determined by parameters of cochlear frequency tuning and vary with location in the cochlea. The step height is approximately equal to the bandwidth of the auditory filter (critical band), and the step width matches that of the spatial excitation pattern produced by a low-level pure tone. Stepwise tonotopy is an emergent property arising from wave reflection and interference within the cochlea, the same mechanisms responsible for the microstructure of the hearing threshold. Possible relationships between the microstructure of the cochlear map and the tiered tonotopy observed in the inferior colliculus are explored.},

abstract = {Temporal information in acoustic signals is important for the perception of environmental sounds, including speech. This review focuses on several aspects of temporal processing within human auditory cortex and its relevance for the processing of speech sounds. Periodic non-speech sounds, such as trains of acoustic clicks and bursts of amplitude-modulated noise or tones, can elicit different percepts depending on the pulse repetition rate or modulation frequency. Such sounds provide convenient methodological tools to study representation of timing information in the auditory system. At low repetition rates of up to 8-10 Hz, each individual stimulus (a single click or a sinusoidal amplitude modulation cycle) within the sequence is perceived as a separate event. As repetition rates increase up to and above approximately 40 Hz, these events blend together, giving rise first to the percept of flutter and then to pitch. The extent to which neural responses of human auditory cortex encode temporal features of acoustic stimuli is discussed within the context of these perceptual classes of periodic stimuli and their relationship to speech sounds. Evidence for neural coding of temporal information at the level of the core auditory cortex in humans suggests possible physiological counterparts to perceptual categorical boundaries for periodic acoustic stimuli. Temporal coding is less evident in auditory cortical fields beyond the core. Finally, data suggest hemispheric asymmetry in temporal cortical processing.},

abstract = {The marginal shell of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus is anatomically and physiologically different from its central core. Previous studies suggest that neurons in the marginal shell are well suited to encode the intensity of acoustic stimuli. To investigate the projections of the marginal shell, a focal injection (<100 nl) of a mixture of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and (3)H-leucine was made into the marginal shell of the cat combined with injection of cholera toxin subunit-B (CTB) into the cochleas. Following a 7-day survival, the cats were perfused. Axons and swellings labeled with BDA and olivocochlear neurons labeled with CTB were immunocytochemically stained black and brown, respectively. (3)H-leucine labels were visualized by autoradiography. Labeled neural structures were examined via light microscopy. We found that swellings labeled with BDA, sometimes doubly labeled with BDA and (3)H-leucine, were in close apposition with dendrites and/or somata of olivocochlear neurons identified with CTB labeling. Double labeling with BDA and (3)H-leucine signifies that the label was anterogradely transported. The results support the conclusion that the anteroventral cochlear nucleus projects to medial olivocochlear neurons bilaterally and to lateral olivocochlear neurons ipsilaterally. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the interpretation that the marginal shell provides a source of the above-mentioned projections. Together with information in the literature, the present anatomical results support a hypothesis that the marginal shell provides information about stimulus intensity as a part of a reflex (or feedback gain control) system comprising the cochlea, cochlear neurons, cochlear nucleus, medial olivocochlear neurons, and cochlear outer hair cells.},

abstract = {Scaling symmetry appears to be a fundamental property of the cochlea as evidenced by invariant distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) phase above ∼1-1.5 kHz when using frequency-scaled stimuli. Below this frequency demarcation, phase steepens. Cochlear scaling and its breaking have been described in the adult cochlea but have not been studied in newborns. It is not clear whether immaturities in cochlear mechanics exist at birth in the human neonate. In this study, DPOAE phase was recorded with a swept-tone protocol in three, octave-wide segments from 0.5 to 4 kHz. The lowest-frequency octave was targeted with increased signal averaging to enhance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and focus on the apical half of the newborn cochlea where breaks from scaling have been observed. The results show: (1) the ear canal DPOAE phase was dominated by the distortion-source component in the low frequencies; thus, the reflection component cannot explain the steeper slope of phase; (2) DPOAE phase-frequency functions from adults and infants showed an unambiguous discontinuity around 1.4 and 1 kHz when described using two- and three-segment fits, respectively, and (3) newborns had a significantly steeper slope of phase in the low-frequency portion of the function which may suggest residual immaturities in the apical half of the newborn cochlea.},

abstract = {Basilar-membrane responses to single tones were measured, using laser velocimetry, at a site of the chinchilla cochlea located 3.5 mm from its basal end. Responses to low-level (< 10-20 dB SPL) characteristic-frequency (CF) tones (9-10 kHz) grow linearly with stimulus intensity and exhibit gains of 66-76 dB relative to stapes motion. At higher levels, CF responses grow monotonically at compressive rates, with input-output slopes as low as 0.2 dB/dB in the intensity range 40-80 dB. Compressive growth, which is significantly correlated with response sensitivity, is evident even at stimulus levels higher than 100 dB. Responses become rapidly linear as stimulus frequency departs from CF. As a result, at stimulus levels > 80 dB the largest responses are elicited by tones with frequency about 0.4-0.5 octave below CF. For stimulus frequencies well above CF, responses stop decreasing with increasing frequency: A plateau is reached. The compressive growth of responses to tones with frequency near CF is accompanied by intensity-dependent phase shifts. Death abolishes all nonlinearities, reduces sensitivity at CF by as much as 60-81 dB, and causes a relative phase lead at CF.},

abstract = {Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are remarkable, mechanically-active receptors that determine the exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity characteristic of the mammalian auditory system. While there are three to four times as many OHCs compared with inner hair cells, OHCs lack a significant afferent innervation and, instead, receive a rich efferent innervation from medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent neurons. Activation of the MOC has been shown to exert a considerable suppressive effect over OHC activity. The precise function of these efferent tracts in auditory behavior, however, is the matter of considerable debate. The most frequent functions assigned to the MOC tracts are to protect the cochlea from traumatic damage associated with intense sound and to aid the detection of signals in noise. While considerable evidence shows that interruption of MOC activity exacerbates damage due to high-level sound exposure, the well characterized MOC physiology and evolutionary studies do not support such a role. Instead, a MOC protective effect is well explained as being a byproduct of the suppressive nature of MOC action on OHC mechanical behavior. A role in the enhancement of signals in noise backgrounds, on the other hand, is well supported by (1) an extensive physiological literature (2) examination of naturally 0ccuring environmental acoustic conditions (3) recent data from multiple laboratories showing that the MOC plays a significant role in auditory selective attention by suppressing the response to unattended or ignored stimuli. This presentation will argue that, based on the extant literature combining the suppression of background noise through MOC-mediated rapid adaptation with the suppression of non-attended signals, in concert with the corticofugal pathways descending from the auditory cortex, the MOC system has one evolved function {\textendash} to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, aiding in the detection of target signals. By contrast, the MOC system r},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Contralateral suppression of the transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) provides a means of studying auditory efferent function, but the temporal dynamics of the reflex are not fully understood. The most fundamental parameter is the time-course of activation of contralateral suppression. The stimulus parameters are likely to be important; this may include temporal dynamics of the suppressor itself. This investigation thus was devoted to the further study of 1) delay of contralateral suppression of TEOAEs-effect of delay of the ipsilateral probe-and 2) temporal variation of the suppressor-effect of amplitude modulation of the contralateral noise stimulus.

DESIGN:Measurements were made in three samples of normal-hearing subjects (N(total) = 71), employing well-established methods of TEOAE assessment.

RESULTS:Statistically significant contralateral suppression occurred some 60 msec after onset of the contralateral noise; thereafter, the effect was essentially constant (i.e., to >180 msec). The results for click delays less than 60 msec, nevertheless, were systematic and readily fitted by a sloping straight line (dB suppression versus time) reminiscent of the concept of threshold power integration. The onset of suppression may thus be characterized by a time constant. The delay of suppression also was found to be reduced by contralateral amplitude-modulated noise.

CONCLUSIONS:These findings reinforce a growing consensus in the literature that, despite initiation perhaps some milliseconds after onset of the contralateral stimulus, there is a substantial delay, i.e., in the tens of milliseconds, before maximal suppression is achieved. The exact time constant of this effect appears to depend upon the combination of probe and suppressor levels, including the temporality of the suppressor. These factors are likely to delimit the role/influence of this reflex in real-world function, favoring perhaps more-or-less sustained suppression that is activated in a time-varying sound environment.},

In the present study, the effects of the addition of contralateral noise on the psychophysical measurements of auditory thresholds were investigated in human subjects with normal hearing. The results obtained in the present study indicate that the addition of contralateral noise at a level of only 20 or 30 dB sound pressure level (SPL) may cause a significant elevation of the auditory threshold in the mid-frequency area (usually 2-3 dB). When the level of contralateral noise was elevated, the elevation of the auditory threshold tended to be larger and the affected frequency area became wider. Although other factors that elevate the auditory thresholds, such as cross-talk effects and the acoustic reflex of the middle ear muscles, may be involved in the above-mentioned paradigm, especially when higher levels of contralateral noise are used, it is important to know the degree of OC-mediated threshold elevation in usual audiometric measurement.},

abstract = {Behavioral manifestations of processing deficits associated with auditory processing disorder (APD) have been well documented. However, little is known about their anatomical underpinnings, especially cochlear processing. Cochlear delays, a proxy for cochlear tuning, measured using stimulus frequency otoacoustic emission (SFOAE) group delay, and the influence of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system activation at the auditory periphery was studied in 23 children suspected with APD (sAPD) and 22 typically developing (TD) children. Results suggest that children suspected with APD have longer SFOAE group delays (possibly due to sharper cochlear tuning) and reduced MOC function compared to TD children. Other differences between the groups include correlation between MOC function and SFOAE delay in quiet in the TD group, and lack thereof in the sAPD group. MOC-mediated changes in SFOAE delay were in opposite directions between groups: increase in delay in TD vs. reduction in delay in the sAPD group. Longer SFOAE group delays in the sAPD group may lead to longer cochlear filter ringing, and potential increase in forward masking. These results indicate differences in cochlear and MOC function between sAPD and TD groups. Further studies are warranted to explore the possibility of cochlea as a potential site for processing deficits in APD.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions (sound emitted from the ear) allow cochlear function to be probed noninvasively. The emissions evoked by pure tones, known as stimulus-frequency emissions (SFOAEs), have been shown to provide reliable estimates of peripheral frequency tuning in a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian species. Here, we apply the same methodology to explore peripheral auditory function in the largest member of the cat family, the tiger (Panthera tigris). We measured SFOAEs in 9 unique ears of 5 anesthetized tigers. The tigers, housed at the Henry Doorly Zoo (Omaha, NE), were of both sexes and ranged in age from 3 to 10 years. SFOAE phase-gradient delays are significantly longer in tigers--by approximately a factor of two above 2 kHz and even more at lower frequencies--than in domestic cats (Felis catus), a species commonly used in auditory studies. Based on correlations between tuning and delay established in other species, our results imply that cochlear tuning in the tiger is significantly sharper than in domestic cat and appears comparable to that of humans. Furthermore, the SFOAE data indicate that tigers have a larger tonotopic mapping constant (mm/octave) than domestic cats. A larger mapping constant in tiger is consistent both with auditory brainstem response thresholds (that suggest a lower upper frequency limit of hearing for the tiger than domestic cat) and with measurements of basilar-membrane length (about 1.5 times longer in the tiger than domestic cat).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:It would be clinically valuable if an electrophysiological validation of hearing aid effectiveness in conveying speech information could be performed when a device is first provided to the individual after electroacoustic verification. This study evaluated envelope following responses (EFRs) elicited by English vowels in a steady state context and in natural sentences. It was the purpose of this study to determine whether EFRs could be detected rapidly enough to be clinically useful.

DESIGN:EFRs were elicited using 5 vowels spanning the English vowel space, /i/, /$\varepsilon$/, /{\ae}/, /(Equation is included in full-text article.)/, and /u/. These were presented either as concatenated steady state vowels (total duration 10.04 seconds) or in three 5-word sentences (total duration 11.77 seconds), where each vowel appeared once per sentence. Single-channel electroencephalogram was recorded from vertex (Cz) to the nape of the neck for 190 and 160 repetitions of the steady state vowels and sentences, respectively. The stimuli were presented at 70 dBA SPL. The fundamental frequency (f0) track from the stimuli was used with a Fourier analyzer to estimate the EFRs to each vowel. Noise amplitudes were also calculated at neighboring frequencies. Fifteen normal-hearing subjects who were 20 to 34 years of age participated in the experiment.

RESULTS:In the analysis of steady state vowels, the mean response amplitude of /i/ was statistically the largest at 173 nV. The other 4 steady state vowels did not differ in mean response amplitude, which varied between 73 and 106 nV. In the analysis of vowels from the 3 sentences, the largest response amplitudes tended to be for /u/. Mean amplitudes for /u/ were 164, 111, and 140 nV for the words "booed," "food," and "Sue," respectively. The vowel /u/ produced statistically larger responses than /i/, /$\varepsilon$/, and /(Equation is included in full-text article.)/ when grouped across words, whereas other vowels did not differ. Mean response amplitudes for the other vowel categories in the sentences varied between 82 and 105 nV. All subjects showed significant EFRs in response to the words "Bee's" and "booed," but only 9 subjects showed significant EFRs for "pet," "bed," and "Bob."

CONCLUSIONS:The authors were readily able to detect significant EFRs elicited by vowels in a steady state context and from 3 natural sentences. These results are promising as an early step in developing a clinical tool for validating that vowel stimuli are at least partially encoded at the level of the auditory brainstem. Future research will require evaluation of the technique with aided listeners, where the natural sentences are expected to be treated as typical speech by hearing aid signal-processing algorithms.},

abstract = {The controlled attention theory of working memory suggests that individuals with greater working memory capacity (WMC) are better able to control or focus their attention than individuals with lesser WMC. This relationship has been observed in a number of selective attention paradigms including a dichotic listening task (Conway, Cowan, {\&} Bunting, 2001) in which participants were required to shadow words presented to one ear and ignore words presented to the other ear. Conway et al. found that when the participant's name was presented to the ignored ear, 65% of participants with low WMC reported hearing their name, compared to only 20% of participants with high WMC, suggesting greater selective attention on the part of high WMC participants. In the present study, individual differences in divided attention were examined in a dichotic listening task, in which participants shadowed one message and listened for their own name in the other message. Here we find that 66.7% of high WMC and 34.5% of low WMC participants detected their name. These results suggest that as WMC capacity increases, so does the ability to control the focus of attention, with high WMC participants being able to flexibly "zoom in" or "zoom out" depending on task demands.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that temporal effects in masking may be consistent with a decrease in cochlear gain. One paradigm used to show this is to measure the level of a long-duration masker required to just mask a short-duration tone that occurs near masker onset. The temporal effect is revealed when the signal is detected at a lower signal-to-noise ratio following preceding stimulation (either an extension of the masker or a separate precursor). The present study examined whether this effect depends on precursor level. The signal was a 10-ms, 4-kHz tone. The masker was 200 ms. A fixed-level precursor had the same frequency characteristics as the masker, and was 205 ms. The masker and precursor had either no notch or a wide notch about the signal frequency. For a given precursor level, the growth of masker level with signal level was determined. These data were used to estimate input-output functions. The results are consistent with a graded decrease in gain at the signal frequency when there is no notch in the masker and precursor, and a graded decrease in suppression when there is a large notch. These results could be consistent with the action of the medial olivocochlear reflex.},

abstract = {The course, distribution and termination of single efferent fibers to the cochlea has been described in only a few animals and relatively few fibers have been studied with knowledge of their ipsilateral or contralateral origin. In order to examine the efferent fibers in the mouse, the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) was iontophoretically injected into one side of the brain stem near the location of known efferent nuclei. Examination of surface preparations of the cochlea revealed detailed information for both the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) and medial olivocochlear (MOC) systems. Many, but not all, fibers entered the cochlea within the intraganglionic spiral bundle (IGSB). The LOC fibers were restricted to the ipsilateral cochlea and rarely branched within the IGSB and osseous spiral lamina (OSL). In the organ of Corti, they traveled either basally or apically in the region of the inner hair cells (IHCs), spanning lengths up to 130 microns (basally) and 890 microns (apically). Terminal swellings of these fibers were ca 3.0 microns in diameter. Numerous en passant swellings were present where the fibers formed a plexus in the area of the IHCs. The MOC fibers followed a similar course in the IGSB and OSL, and within the OSL the fibers had few branches. Within the organ of Corti they traveled apically (up to 70 microns) in the nerve bundles located in the IHC area before they crossed the tunnel of Corti. In the region of the OHCs, 9% of the traceable fibers branched to innervate two to three OHCs while 91% appeared to innervate only one OHC. There was no discernible difference in the distribution of contralateral and ipsilateral MOC projections in terms of cochlear region or outer hair cell rows.},

abstract = {The auditory efferent system originates in the auditory cortex and projects to the medial geniculate body (MGB), inferior colliculus (IC), cochlear nucleus (CN) and superior olivary complex (SOC) reaching the cochlea through olivocochlear (OC) fibers. This unique neuronal network is organized in several afferent-efferent feedback loops including: the (i) colliculo-thalamic-cortico-collicular; (ii) cortico-(collicular)-OC; and (iii) cortico-(collicular)-CN pathways. Recent experiments demonstrate that blocking ongoing auditory-cortex activity with pharmacological and physical methods modulates the amplitude of cochlear potentials. In addition, auditory-cortex microstimulation independently modulates cochlear sensitivity and the strength of the OC reflex. In this mini-review, anatomical and physiological evidence supporting the presence of a functional efferent network from the auditory cortex to the cochlear receptor is presented. Special emphasis is given to the corticofugal effects on initial auditory processing, that is, on CN, auditory nerve and cochlear responses. A working model of three parallel pathways from the auditory cortex to the cochlea and auditory nerve is proposed.},

abstract = {Recent work shows that acoustic overexposures causing only transient threshold elevation, and no hair cell loss, nevertheless can cause irreversible loss of the synapses between inner hair cells and cochlear nerve fibers (Kujawa and Liberman 2009). This cochlear synaptopathy, which is selective for the subset of sensory fibers with high thresholds and low spontaneous rates (Furman et al. 2013), appeared fully developed at 24-h post-exposure and showed no recovery by 8 weeks. However, prior studies of this synaptopathy counted only pre-synaptic ribbons, did not examine post-exposure times less than 24 h, and did not analyze the spatial patterns of degeneration around the hair cell circumference. Here, we immunostained for pre-synaptic ribbons, post-synaptic terminals and glutamate receptor patches, as well as the hair cell cytoplasm in noise-exposed and control mice to address the dynamics and spatial organization of the synaptopathic process as a function of post-exposure time from 0 h to 2 weeks. Our analysis showed that the loss of synaptic elements is nearly complete immediately after the 2-h exposure, that there is a reversible downregulation of gluR expression in the peripheral terminals which may be part of a protective mechanism, that there may be reversible reorganization of synaptic locations immediately after exposure, and that the spatial patterns are consistent with the idea that low-SR fibers are mainly found on the modiolar face of the hair cell and are the most vulnerable to noise-induced degeneration.},

abstract = {The existence of a phonemic deficit that is predictive of, and probably causal to, many cases of reading difficulty is well established. Tallal (1984) has suggested that this phonemic deficit is in fact a symptom of an underlying auditory temporal processing deficit. Our purpose in this paper is to evaluate the plausibility of this hypothesis. The various components that might constitute sequential (or temporal) processing are described. Our review of the literature reveals considerable evidence for a deficit in dyslexics in stimulus individuation tasks (e.g., gap detection) and temporal order judgments in both the auditory and visual modalities. The possibility that a general temporal processing deficit is associated with dyslexia, as suggested by Tallal (1984), is explored, and possible etiologies for such a deficit are discussed. The possibility of a causal link between temporal processing deficits and some reading disabilities is demonstrated, and converging evidence from morphological studies is reviewed. It is concluded that a temporal processing deficit does appear to be present in many developmental dyslexics, and strategies are suggested for further research aimed at evaluating the hypothesis that this deficit may be the root cause of a number of cases of dyslexia itself.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that auditory attention tasks may modulate the sensitivity of the cochlea by way of the corticofugal and the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent pathways. Here, we studied the extent to which a separate efferent tract, the 'uncrossed' MOC, which functionally connects the two ears, mediates inter-aural selective attention. We compared distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in one ear with binaurally presented primaries, using an intermodal target detection task in which participants were instructed to report the occurrence of brief target events (visual changes, tones). Three tasks were compared under identical physical stimulation: (i) report brief tones in the ear in which DPOAE responses were recorded; (ii) report brief tones presented to the contralateral, non-recorded ear; and (iii) report brief phase shifts of a visual grating at fixation. Effects of attention were observed as parallel shifts in overall DPOAE contour level, with DPOAEs relatively higher in overall level when subjects ignored the auditory stimuli and attended to the visual stimulus, compared with both of the auditory-attending conditions. Importantly, DPOAE levels were statistically lowest when attention was directed to the ipsilateral ear in which the DPOAE recordings were made. These data corroborate notions that top-down mechanisms, via the corticofugal and medial efferent pathways, mediate cochlear responses during intermodal attention. New findings show attending to one ear can significantly alter the physiological response of the contralateral, unattended ear, probably through the uncrossed-medial olivocochlear efferent fibers connecting the two ears.},

abstract = {Past work applying otoacoustic emissions to gauge maturational status of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex in human newborns has produced mixed results. The present study revisits the question while considering the dual nature of the 2f(1) - f(2) distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and expanding measures of medial efferent function. Subjects included premature and term-born neonates, 6-month-old infants and young adults. The MOC reflex was elicited with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS) while shifts in amplitude and phase of the DPOAE, and its distortion and reflection components, were monitored. Overall, CAS-elicited reductions in DPOAE level did not differ among age groups. For all ages, the MOC reflex was strongest at frequencies below 1.5 kHz, and the reflection component of the DPOAE was most affected, showing maximally reduced amplitude and shallower phase slope when contralateral noise was presented. Results suggest that the MOC reflex likely reaches maturation prior to full-term birth. However, prematurely born neonates show markedly more episodes of CAS-induced DPOAE level enhancement. This may be due to more intrusive component mixing in this age group or disruptions in the formation of the MOC pathway or synapse in the most premature neonates.},

abstract = {Neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) analyze interaural time differences (ITDs) by comparing the arrival times of the two excitatory inputs from each ear using a coincidence detection mechanism. They also receive a prominent inhibitory, glycinergic projection from the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), which contributes to the fine-tuning of ITD analysis. Here, we investigated developmental changes of the axonal arborisation pattern of single Microruby-labeled MNTB neurons projecting to the MSO region. During the first 2 weeks after hearing onset, the axonal arborisation of MNTB neurons was significantly refined resulting in a narrowed projection area across the tonotopic axis of the MSO and a redistribution of the axonal endsegments to a mostly somatic location. Rearing the animals in omnidirectional noise prevented the structural changes of single MNTB projections. These results indicate that the functional elimination of inhibitory inputs on MSO neurons after hearing onset, as described previously, is paralleled by a structural, site-specific refinement of the inputs and is dependent on the normal acoustic experience of the animal.},

abstract = {Cochlear sensory cells and neurons receive efferent feedback from the olivocochlear (OC) system. The myelinated medial component of the OC system and its effects on outer hair cells (OHCs) have been implicated in protection from acoustic injury. The unmyelinated lateral (L)OC fibers target ipsilateral cochlear nerve dendrites and pharmacological studies suggest the LOC's dopaminergic component may protect these dendrites from excitotoxic effects of acoustic overexposure. Here, we explore LOC function in vivo by selective stereotaxic destruction of LOC cell bodies in mouse. Lesion success in removing the LOC, and sparing the medial (M)OC, was assessed by histological analysis of brain stem sections and cochlear whole mounts. Auditory brain stem responses (ABRs), a neural-based metric, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), an OHC-based metric, were measured in control and surgical mice. In cases where the LOC was at least partially destroyed, there were increases in suprathreshold neural responses that were frequency- and level-independent and not attributable to OHC-based effects. These interaural response asymmetries were not found in controls or in cases where the lesion missed the LOC. In LOC-lesion cases, after exposure to a traumatic stimulus, temporary threshold shifts were greater in the ipsilateral ear, but only when measured in the neural response; OHC-based measurements were always bilaterally symmetric, suggesting OHC vulnerability was unaffected. Interaural asymmetries in threshold shift were not found in either unlesioned controls or in cases that missed the LOC. These findings suggest that the LOC modulates cochlear nerve excitability and protects the cochlea from neural damage in acute acoustic injury.},

abstract = {The shape of the auditory filter was estimated at three center frequencies, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kHz, for five subjects with unilateral cochlear impairments. Additional measurements were made at 1.0 kHz using one subject with a unilateral impairment and six subjects with bilateral impairments. Subjects were chosen who had thresholds in the impaired ears which were relatively flat as a function of frequency and ranged from 15 to 70 dB HL. The filter shapes were estimated by measuring thresholds for sinusoidal signals (frequency f) in the presence of two bands of noise, 0.4 f wide, one above and one below f. The spectrum level of the noise was 50 dB (re: 20 mu Pa) and the noise bands were placed both symmetrically and asymmetrically about the signal frequency. The deviation of the nearer edge of each noise band from f varied from 0.0 to 0.8 f. For the normal ears, the filters were markedly asymmetric for center frequencies of 1.0 and 2.0 kHz, the high-frequency branch being steeper. At 0.5 kHz, the filters were more symmetric. For the impaired ears, the filter shapes varied considerably from one subject to another. For most subjects, the lower branch of the filter was much less steep than normal. The upper branch was often less steep than normal, but a few subjects showed a near normal upper branch. For the subjects with unilateral impairments, the equivalent rectangular bandwidth of the filter was always greater for the impaired ear than for the normal ear at each center frequency. For three subjects at 0.5 kHz and one subject at 1.0 kHz, the filter had too little selectivity for its shape to be determined.},

abstract = {The dynamic adjustment of hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity is mediated by the medial olivocochlear efferent reflex, which suppresses the gain of the 'cochlear amplifier' in each ear. Such efferent feedback is important for promoting discrimination of sounds in background noise, sound localization and protecting the cochleae from acoustic overstimulation. However, the sensory driver for the olivocochlear reflex is unknown. Here, we resolve this longstanding question using a mouse model null for the gene encoding the type III intermediate filament peripherin (Prph). Prph((-/-)) mice lacked type II spiral ganglion neuron innervation of the outer hair cells, whereas innervation of the inner hair cells by type I spiral ganglion neurons was normal. Compared with Prph((+/+)) controls, both contralateral and ipsilateral olivocochlear efferent-mediated suppression of the cochlear amplifier were absent in Prph((-/-)) mice, demonstrating that outer hair cells and their type II afferents constitute the sensory drive for the olivocochlear efferent reflex.},

In the present study, we investigated the effect of focused auditory attention on the population-level frequency tuning in human auditory cortex by means of magnetoencephalography. Using complex stimuli consisting of a test tone superimposed on different band-eliminated noises during active listening or distracted listening conditions, we observed that focused auditory attention caused not only gain, but also sharpening of frequency tuning in human auditory cortex as reflected by the N1m auditory evoked response. This combination of gain and sharpening in the auditory cortex may contribute to better auditory performance during focused auditory attention.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To determine whether the source of age-dependent latency changes for ABR wave I results from cochlear mechanics or the haircell-neuron synapse.

DESIGN:Cochlear traveling wave delays were estimated on the basis of derived ABR response latencies and DPOAE phase delays. The difference in travel time between adjacent one octave-separated frequencies was calculated for four age groups: 30 to 33 wk old, 34 to 37 wk old, 38 to 42 wk old (term), and young adults.

RESULTS:We found that there were essentially no travel time differences between newborns in the 34 to 37 and the 38 to 42 wk conceptional age (CA) groups as estimated from DPOAE phase delays. For the 30- to 33-wk-olds, DPOAE travel times were increased at all frequencies, likely due to mild (about 10 to 15 dB) conductive hearing losses. Differences in travel times between adjacent bands, however, were not different from the other neonatal groups. Estimates on basis of wave I latency showed delays for the high-frequency region, 6 to 11 kHz, that were still immature at term.

CONCLUSIONS:A comparison of frequency-dependent travel times calculated for wave I and DPOAE data in comparable age groups suggests mature cochlear functioning at 35 wk CA and a delayed maturation for the haircell-auditory nerve synapses relative to the preneural components for the basal turn with center frequencies above 6 kHz.},

abstract = {Sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (AM) tones are frequently used in psychophysical and physiological studies, yet a comprehensive study on the coding of AM tones in the auditory nerve is lacking. AM responses of single auditory-nerve fibers of the cat are studied, systematically varying modulation depth, frequency, and sound level. Synchrony-level functions were nonmonotonic with maximum values that were inversely correlated with spontaneous rate (SR). In most fibers, envelope phase-locking showed a positive gain. Modulation transfer functions were uniformly low pass. Their corner frequency increased with characteristic frequency (CF), but changed little for CFs above 10 kHz. The highest modulation frequencies to which phase locking occurred were more than 0.8 oct lower than the highest frequencies to which phase locking to pure tones occurs. Cumulative, or unwrapped, phase increased linearly with modulation frequency: The slope was inversely related to CF, and slightly higher than group delays reported for pure tones. High SR, low CF fibers showed the poorest envelope phase locking. In some low CF fibers, phase locking increased at high levels, associated with "peak-splitting" phenomena. Changes in average rate due to modulation were small, and could be enhancement or suppression.},

abstract = {The exceptional performance of mammalian hearing is due to the cochlea's amplification of sound-induced mechanical stimuli. During acoustic stimulation, the vertical motion of the outer hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane (TM) is converted into the lateral motion of their stereocilia. The actual mode of this conversion, which represents a fundamental step in hearing, remains enigmatic, as it is unclear why the stereocilia are deflected when pressed against the TM, rather than penetrating it. In this study we show that deflection of the stereocilia is a direct outcome of the anisotropic material properties of the TM. Using force spectroscopy, we find that the vertical stiffness of the TM is significantly larger than its lateral stiffness. As a result, the TM is more resistant to the vertical motion of stereocilia than to their lateral motion, and so they are deflected laterally when pushed against the TM. Our findings are confirmed by finite element simulations of the mechanical interaction between the TM and stereocilia, which show that the vertical outer hair cells motion is converted into lateral stereocilia motion when the experimentally determined stiffness values are incorporated into the model. Our results thus show that the material properties of the TM play a central and previously unknown role in mammalian hearing.},

abstract = {In Part I, the sound emitting properties of the peripheral auditory system are briefly reviewed and links with other literature are cited. (Summary of Symposium section introduction). In Part II, the stimulation of acoustic emissions by clicks is examined experimentally and analytically, in order to specify the physical qualities and parameters of the unknown generator which may be considered as driving the ear drum. Special attention is paid to absolute magnitudes to the qualitative interpretation of the generator's nonlinear properties and to the extent of inter-stimulus interactions in the time and frequency domains. New transient suppression results are presented. From the observations made, and without reference to the likely cochlear origin of the phenomenon, it is deduced that the generator is a multiple channel system, with each channel consisting of at least a steep-sloped narrow band filter followed by a fast acting compressive nonlinearity. A secondary nonlinearity seems also to be present, of a form which requires the filter itself to be nonlinear. The maximum power output of the generator is of the order 0.26 X 10(-12) W.},

abstract = {Medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons project from the brain to the cochlea to form the efferent limb of the MOC reflex. To study synaptic inputs to MOC neurons, we retrogradely labeled these neurons using horseradish peroxidase injections into the cochlea. Labeled neurons were identified in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body and documented with the light microscope before being studied with serial-section electron microscopy. MOC somata and dendrites were innervated by three different types of synapses, distinguished as either having: 1) large, round synaptic vesicles and forming asymmetric contacts; 2) small, round vesicles plus a few dense core vesicles and forming asymmetric contacts; or 3) pleomorphic vesicles and forming symmetric contacts. The first two types were the most frequent on somata. Acetylcholinesterase-stained material confirmed that the type containing large, round vesicles is most common on dendrites. We kept track of the synaptic terminals in serial sections and compiled them into three-dimensional swellings. Swellings with large, round vesicles formed up to seven synapses per swelling, were largest in size, and sometimes formed complex arrangements engulfing spines of MOC neurons. Swellings with small, round vesicles formed up to four synapses per swelling. The morphology of this type of synapse, and the moderate sizes of the swellings forming it, suggests that it originates from posteroventral cochlear nucleus stellate/multipolar neurons. This input may thus provide the sound-evoked input to MOC neurons that causes their reflexive response to sound.},

abstract = {This paper examines how short-term energy fluctuations in a masker affect the thresholds for tones at frequencies above those of the masker. Two equally intense tones at 1060 and 1075 Hz produce up to 25 dB less masking than does a 1075-Hz tone set to the overall level of the two-tone complex. At wider frequency separations, two-tone complexes also produce less masking than the pure tone. These results indicate that envelope fluctuations in a masker, whose spectrum is confined to a single critical band, may result in release from masking. The release from masking probably is related to the comodulation masking release reported by Hall et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 76, 50-56 (1984b)] for modulated-noise maskers with bandwidths greater than one critical band. Further measurements with maskers, whose intensity level in the critical band around 1 kHz was 90 dB SPL, show similar masking by a pure tone and a 625- to 1075-Hz bandpass noise, but less masking by narrow-band noises. These results are inconsistent with a simple frequency selective energy-detector model and indicate that the auditory system can use periods of low masker energy as brief as a few ms to enhance detection of a tone. The results also imply that the upward spread of excitation is best represented by masking patterns for noises with bandwidths of several critical bands.},

abstract = {Studies have demonstrated that selective attention can modulate the steady-state evoked potential to repetitive visual and tactile stimulation. However, examinations of the effect of attention on the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) have proven equivocal. The current experiment therefore utilized EEG to examine the effect of attention on the ASSR in healthy humans (n=15). Auditory click trains in the beta (20 Hz) and gamma (40 Hz) ranges were randomly presented binaurally in an oddball discrimination paradigm (each frequency served as the oddball (target) in each of two blocks). A Fast Fourier Transform was used to assess the effect of attention on the ASSR (signal power), and phase consistency across trials was assessed using the phase-locking factor (PLF). As expected, both 20 and 40 Hz targets elicited a robust P300 response, with maximal amplitudes over parietal regions. For the ASSR, it was found that EEG signal power was larger to 40 Hz targets compared to 40 Hz frequent stimuli across all frontocentral electrodes. No differences in signal power were observed during 20 Hz stimulation. Finally, increased PLF values were observed for 40 Hz targets compared to frequent trials. These results provide evidence that selective attention can enhance signal power and phase-locking of the ASSR, particularly to auditory stimulation in the gamma range.},

abstract = {Observing a speaker's mouth profoundly influences speech perception. For example, listeners perceive an "illusory" "ta" when the video of a face producing /ka/ is dubbed onto an audio /pa/. Here, we show how cortical areas supporting speech production mediate this illusory percept and audiovisual (AV) speech perception more generally. Specifically, cortical activity during AV speech perception occurs in many of the same areas that are active during speech production. We find that different perceptions of the same syllable and the perception of different syllables are associated with different distributions of activity in frontal motor areas involved in speech production. Activity patterns in these frontal motor areas resulting from the illusory "ta" percept are more similar to the activity patterns evoked by AV(/ta/) than they are to patterns evoked by AV(/pa/) or AV(/ka/). In contrast to the activity in frontal motor areas, stimulus-evoked activity for the illusory "ta" in auditory and somatosensory areas and visual areas initially resembles activity evoked by AV(/pa/) and AV(/ka/), respectively. Ultimately, though, activity in these regions comes to resemble activity evoked by AV(/ta/). Together, these results suggest that AV speech elicits in the listener a motor plan for the production of the phoneme that the speaker might have been attempting to produce, and that feedback in the form of efference copy from the motor system ultimately influences the phonetic interpretation.},

abstract = {When two identical sounds are presented from different locations with a short interval between them, the perception is of a single sound source at the location of the leading sound. This "precedence effect" is an important behavioral phenomenon whose neural basis is being increasingly studied. For this report, neural responses were recorded to paired clicks with varying interstimulus intervals, from several structures of the ascending auditory system in unanesthetized animals. The structures tested were the auditory nerve, anteroventral cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, inferior colliculus, and primary auditory cortex. The main finding is a progressive increase in the duration of the suppressive effect of the leading sound (the conditioner) on the response to the lagging sound (the probe). The first major increase occurred between the lower brainstem and inferior colliculus, and the second between the inferior colliculus and auditory cortex. In neurons from the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and superior olivary complex, 50% recovery of the response to the probe occurred, on average, for conditioner and probe intervals of approximately 2 ms. In the inferior colliculus, 50% recovery occurred at an average separation of approximately 7 ms, and in the auditory cortex at approximately 20 ms. Despite these increases in average recovery times, some neurons in every structure showed large responses to the probe within the time window for precedence (approximately 1-4 ms for clicks). This indicates that during the period of the precedence effect, some information about echoes is retained. At the other extreme, for some cortical neurons the conditioner suppressed the probe response for intervals of up to 300 ms. This is in accord with behavioral results that show dominance of the leading sound for an extended period beyond that of the precedence effect. Other transformations as information ascended included an increased variety in the shapes of the recovery functions in structures subsequent to the nerve, and neurons "tuned" to particular conditioner-probe intervals in the auditory cortex. These latter are reminiscent of neurons tuned to echo delay in bats, and may contribute to the perception of the size of the acoustic space.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine if active listening modulates the strength of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex in children. Design: Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) were recorded from the right ear in quiet and in four test conditions: one with contralateral broadband noise (BBN) only, and three with active listening tasks wherein attention was directed to speech embedded in contralateral BBN. Study sample: Fifteen typically-developing children (ranging in age from 8 to14 years) with normal hearing. Results: CEOAE levels were reduced in every condition with contralateral acoustic stimulus (CAS) when compared to preceding quiet conditions. There was an additional systematic decrease in CEOAE level with increased listening task difficulty, although this effect was very small. These CEOAE level differences were most apparent in the 8-18 ms region after click onset. Conclusions: Active listening may change the strength of the MOC reflex in children, although the effects reported here are very subtle. Further studies are needed to verify that task difficulty modulates the activity of the MOC reflex in children.},

abstract = {Because the human visual system is continually being bombarded with inputs, it is necessary to have effective mechanisms for filtering out irrelevant information. This is partly achieved by the allocation of attention, allowing the visual system to process relevant input while blocking out irrelevant input. What is the physiological substrate of attentional allocation? It has been proposed that alpha activity reflects functional inhibition. Here we asked if inhibition by alpha oscillations has behavioral consequences for suppressing the perception of unattended input. To this end, we investigated the influence of alpha activity on motion processing in two attentional conditions using magneto-encephalography. The visual stimuli used consisted of two random-dot kinematograms presented simultaneously to the left and right visual hemifields. Subjects were cued to covertly attend the left or right kinematogram. After 1.5 sec, a second cue tested whether subjects could report the direction of coherent motion in the attended (80%) or unattended hemifield (20%). Occipital alpha power was higher contralateral to the unattended side than to the attended side, thus suggesting inhibition of the unattended hemifield. Our key finding is that this alpha lateralization in the 20% invalidly cued trials did correlate with the perception of motion direction: Subjects with pronounced alpha lateralization were worse at detecting motion direction in the unattended hemifield. In contrast, lateralization did not correlate with visual discrimination in the attended visual hemifield. Our findings emphasize the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and suggest that processing of inputs outside the field of attention is weakened by means of increased alpha activity.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that during periods of attention to specific stimuli there are changes in the neural activity of central auditory structures; however, it is controversial whether attention can modulate auditory responses at the cochlear level. Several studies performed in animals as well as in humans have attempted to find a modulation of cochlear responses during visual attention with contradictory results. Here, we have appraised cochlear sensitivity in behaving chinchillas by measuring, with a chronically implanted round-window electrode, sound-evoked auditory-nerve compound action potentials and cochlear microphonics, a measure of outer hair cell function, during selective attention to visual stimuli. Chinchillas were trained in a visual discrimination or in an auditory frequency discrimination two-choice task. We found a significant decrease of cochlear sensitivity during the period of attention to visual stimuli in the animals performing the visual discrimination task, but not in those performing the auditory task, demonstrating that this physiological effect is related to selective attention to visual stimuli rather than to an increment in arousal level. Furthermore, the magnitude of the cochlear-sensitivity reductions increased in sessions performed with shorter target-light durations (4-0.5 s), suggesting that this effect is stronger for higher attentional demands of the task. These results demonstrate that afferent auditory activity is modulated by selective attention as early as at sensory transduction, possibly through activation of olivocochlear efferent fibers.},

A group of children with LDs (n = 63) and a control group of children without LDs (n = 36) were presented with simple English sentences embedded in noise. Factors that varied within participants were speaking style (conversational vs. clear) and signal-to-noise ratio (-4 dB vs. -8 dB); talker (male vs. female) varied between participants. Results indicated that the group of children with LDs had poorer overall sentence-in-noise perception than the control group. Furthermore, both groups had poorer speech perception with decreasing signal-to-noise ratio; however the children with LDs were more adversely affected by a decreasing signal-to-noise ratio than the control group. Both groups benefited substantially from naturally produced clear speech, and for both groups, the female talker evoked a larger clear speech benefit than the male talker. The clear speech benefit was consistent across groups; required no listener training; and, for a large proportion of the children with LDs, was sufficient to bring their performance within the range of the control group with conversational speech. Moreover, an acoustic comparison of conversational-to-clear speech modifications across the two talkers provided insight into the acoustic-phonetic features of naturally produced clear speech that are most important for promoting intelligibility for this population.},

abstract = {We live in a noisy world! In all applications (telecommunications, hands-free communications, recording, human-machine interfaces, etc.) that require at least one microphone, the signal of interest is usually contaminated by noise and reverberation. As a result, the microphone signal has to be 'cleaned' with digital signal processing tools before it is played out, transmitted, or stored. This book is about speech enhancement. Different well-known and state-of-the-art methods for noise reduction, with one or multiple microphones, are discussed. By speech enhancement, we mean not only noise reduction but also dereverberation and separation of independent signals. These topics are also covered in this book. However, the general emphasis is on noise reduction because of the large number of applications that can benefit from this technology. The goal of this book is to provide a strong reference for researchers, engineers, and graduate students who are interested in the problem of signal and speech enhancement. To do so, we invited well-known experts to contribute chapters covering the state of the art in this focused field.},

abstract = {High-resolution measurements of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) from three different experimental paradigms are shown to be in agreement with the implications of a realistic "two-source" cochlear model of DPOAE fine structure. The measurements of DPOAE amplitude and phase imply an interference phenomenon involving one source in the region of strong nonlinear interaction of the primary waves (the strong "overlap" or generation region), and the other source region around the DPOAE tonotopic place. The component from the DPOAE place can be larger than the one from the generator region. These findings are supported by the analysis of the onset and offset of the DPOAE when the higher-frequency primary is pulsed on and off. The two-source hypothesis was further tested by adding a third tone closer in frequency to the DPOAE which modifies the amplitude of the component from the DPOAE place and leaves the one from the generator region unchanged. The results agree well with the model prediction that the variation with frequency, and implied latency, of the phase of the DPOAE tonotopic-place component are greater than the corresponding quantities for the component from the generation region.},

abstract = {The representation of the speech syllables /da/ and /ba/ in populations of auditory-nerve fibers was studied. Post-stimulus-time histograms were computed from 20-ms segments of fiber spike trains occurring in response to the stimulus. Discrete Fourier transforms with a resolution of 50 Hz were computed from each histogram. As a measure of the response of the population of fibers to each harmonic of the 50-Hz resolution frequency of the transform, the magnitude of the response to that frequency was averaged across all fibers whose characteristic frequencies were within one-fourth octave of that harmonic. We have previously called this measure the average localized synchronized rate (ALSR). Response profiles for the 20-ms segments of the stimulus were generated by plotting the ALSR versus frequency. Time-varying spectral features of the /da/ and /ba/ stimuli are well preserved by such profiles. For example, the onset spectrum and formant transitions of the consonant-vowel syllable are well represented. Furthermore, the fine structure in the speech spectrum related to the pitch of the excitation source is maintained in these ALSR plots. Average discharge rate profiles were generated in a manner similar to that for the ALSR; in this case average rate replaces Fourier transform components as response measure. Such average rate profiles can represent the transitions of at least formants two and three. However, such average rate profiles do not represent the steady-state formants or the voice pitch.},

abstract = {Loud sounds are a common cause of hearing loss. Very intense sounds may result in permanent hearing loss, but lower levels typically cause a transient decrease in auditory sensitivity. Studies have arrived at different conclusions as regards the physiological mechanisms underlying such temporary threshold shifts. Here, we investigated the effect of acoustic overstimulation on the mechanics of the low-frequency areas of the guinea pig cochlea. We demonstrate that brief loud sound exposure results in an increased phase lag and a paradoxical frequency-specific increase of sound-evoked displacement. Despite the increased displacement, electrically evoked motion is reduced. Because electromotility is important for amplifying low-level sounds, this change was associated with a decrease in measures of cochlear amplification. These changes recovered over the course of 30-40~min. Overstimulation also caused an increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels of both hair cells and supporting cells. These data suggest that reduced organ of Corti stiffness contributes to temporary threshold shifts.},

abstract = {Speech recognition in noisy environments improves when the speech signal is spatially separated from the interfering sound. This effect, known as spatial release from masking (SRM), was recently shown in young children. The present study compared SRM in children of ages 5-7 with adults for interferers introducing energetic, informational, and/or linguistic components. Three types of interferers were used: speech, reversed speech, and modulated white noise. Two female voices with different long-term spectra were also used. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were compared for: Quiet (target 0 degrees front, no interferer), Front (target and interferer both 0 degrees front), and Right (interferer 90 degrees right, target 0 degrees front). Children had higher SRTs and greater masking than adults. When spatial cues were not available, adults, but not children, were able to use differences in interferer type to separate the target from the interferer. Both children and adults showed SRM. Children, unlike adults, demonstrated large amounts of SRM for a time-reversed speech interferer. In conclusion, masking and SRM vary with the type of interfering sound, and this variation interacts with age; SRM may not depend on the spectral peculiarities of a particular type of voice when the target speech and interfering speech are different sex talkers.},

This study examined this effect in patients with extrinsic and intrinsic lesions of the brainstem which may affect the efferent pathway either within the vestibular nerve which carries the efferent bundle to the cochlea or within the brainstem at the level of the SOC. Suppression is reduced or absent in these patients and the site and size of the lesion determines whether the suppression is affected unilaterally or bilaterally. Lesions affecting the auditory afferent pathway without significant alteration in hearing appear to affect the efferent pathway too.},

abstract = {Suppression tuning curves (STCs) for spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) were longitudinally obtained in seven infants (at 3 weeks, 2 months, and 3, 4, or 6 months of age) and in five adults. Excellent reproducibility was obtained for adult STCs. Reproducibility for infant STCs was poorer, but the curves at each age resemble those of adults both qualitatively and quantitatively as measured by slopes of the lower and upper segments of the STCs and by Q10's. Evidence from two subjects suggests that developmental changes in the fine tuning of the system may occur postnatally. Results are discussed with respect to the development of cochlear frequency selectivity.},

abstract = {The precedence effect refers to an auditory phenomenon which occurs when two similar sounds are presented from different locations with a brief delay, and only one sound is heard whose perceived location is dominated by the first source. Although the lagging source si not localized as an independent event, under some conditions, adults are able to extract its directional cues. Developmental studies suggest that this ability changes during the development. However, those studies have used stimulus configurations which minimize the measurement of that ability. In the present study adults were first tested under several conditions, and the one which produced optimal performance was chosen for testing children. Using the minimum audible angle (MAA) task in the azimuthal plane, performance was compared for a single-source condition and two precedence conditions: in lag discrimination the lagging source changed location while the lead remained at midline, and in lead discrimination the reverse occurred. Subjects were 18 months old, 5 years old, and adult. Significant improvements in MAA occurred with an increase in age, especially in the precedence conditions. Within each group, performance was significantly better in single-source condition, followed by the lead and the lag discrimination.},

abstract = {Forward masking growth functions were measured for pure-tone maskers and signals at 2 and 6 kHz as a function of the silent interval between the masker and signal. The inclusion of conditions involving short signals and short masker-signal intervals ensured that a wide range of signal thresholds were recorded. A consistent pattern was seen across all the results. When the signal level was below about 35 dB SPL the growth of masking was shallow, so that signal threshold increased at a much slower rate than masker level. When the signal level exceeded this value, the masking function steepened, approaching unity (linear growth) at the highest masker and signal levels. The results are inconsistent with an explanation for forward-masking growth in terms of saturating neural adaptation. Instead the data are well described by a model incorporating a simulation of the basilar-membrane response at characteristic frequency (which is almost linear at low levels and compressive at higher levels) followed by a sliding intensity integrator or temporal window. Taken together with previous results, the findings suggest that the principle nonlinearity in temporal masking may be the basilar membrane response function, and that subsequent to this the auditory system behaves as if it were linear in the intensity domain.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emission (OAE) amplitude can be reduced by acoustic stimulation. This effect is produced by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. Past studies have shown that the MOC reflex is related to listening in noise and attention. In the present study, the relationship between strength of the contralateral MOC reflex and masked threshold was investigated in 19 adults. Detection thresholds were determined for 1000-Hz, 300-ms tone presented simultaneously with one repetition of a 300-ms masker in an ongoing train of masker bursts. Three masking conditions were tested: 1) broadband noise 2) a fixed-frequency 4-tone complex masker and 3) a random-frequency 4-tone complex masker. Broadband noise was expected to produce energetic masking and the tonal maskers were expected to produce informational masking in some listeners. DPOAEs were recorded at fine frequency intervals from 500 to 4000~Hz, with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation. MOC reflex strength was estimated as a reduction in baseline level and a shift in frequency of DPOAE fine-structure maxima near 1000-Hz. MOC reflex and psychophysical testing were completed in separate sessions. Individuals with poorer thresholds in broadband noise and in random-frequency maskers were found to have stronger MOC reflexes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:This study investigated whether neurophysiologic responses to repeated speech stimuli, presented in quiet and noise, differed between normal children (NL) and children with learning problems (LP).

METHODS:Subjects were normal-hearing, school-age children. NL subjects scored significantly better than LP subjects on measures of reading, spelling and speech sound discrimination. Stimuli (40 ms /da/) were presented to the right ear at 80 dB SPL. Stimuli were presented in trains of four, separated within trains by 360 ms. The interval between trains was 1060 ms. Stimuli were presented in quiet and in white noise (S/N+15). Cortical responses were recorded from an electrode placed along the midline at Cz.

RESULTS:Correlations between the first and 4th responses were lower in noise than in quiet for LP subjects only. Response correlations in quiet were no different between groups. There were no root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude differences between groups.

CONCLUSIONS:Response correlation in noise suggested that the LP population consisted of two subgroups, one whose responses appeared relatively normal, and another whose responses were severely degraded by repetition in noise. Response correlations in noise were related to behavioral measures of auditory processing and spelling. These findings suggest that abnormal, asynchronous, auditory cortical encoding may underlie some language-based learning problems.},

abstract = {Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are thought to be by-products of an active amplification process in the cochlea and thus serve as a metric for evaluating the integrity of this process. Because the cochlear amplifier functions in a level-dependent fashion, DPOAEs recorded as a function of stimulus level (i.e., a DPOAE growth function) may provide important information about the range and operational characteristics of the cochlear amplifier. The DPOAE growth functions recorded in human adults and neonates may provide information about the maturation of these active cochlear processes. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment I included normal-hearing adults and term-born neonates. The 2f1-f2 DPOAE growth functions were recorded for both age groups at three f2 frequencies. Experiment II was an extension of the first experiment but added a subject group of premature neonates. The results of these studies indicate that DPOAE growth functions most often show amplitude saturation and nonmonotonic growth for all age groups. However, premature neonates show monotonic growth and the absence of amplitude saturation more often than adults. Those premature neonates who do show saturation also show an elevated threshold for amplitude saturation relative to adults. In contrast, term neonates are adultlike for most measures except that they show a larger percentage of nonsaturating growth functions than adults. These results may indicate immaturity in cochlear amplifier function prior to term birth in humans. Outer hair cell function and/or efferent regulation of outer hair cell function are hypothesized sources of this immaturity, although some contribution from the immature middle ear cannot be ruled out.},

Here we demonstrate that the mammalian EP can be used as a power source for electronic devices. We achieved this by designing an anatomically sized, ultra-low quiescent-power energy harvester chip integrated with a wireless sensor capable of monitoring the EP itself. Although other forms of in vivo energy harvesting have been described in lower organisms, and thermoelectric, piezoelectric and biofuel devices are promising for mammalian applications, there have been few, if any, in vivo demonstrations in the vicinity of the ear, eye and brain. In this work, the chip extracted a minimum of 1.12 nW from the EP of a guinea pig for up to 5 h, enabling a 2.4 GHz radio to transmit measurement of the EP every 40-360 s. With future optimization of electrode design, we envision using the biologic battery in the inner ear to power chemical and molecular sensors, or drug-delivery actuators for diagnosis and therapy of hearing loss and other disorders.},

abstract = {Objects on a collision course with an observer produce a specific pattern of optical expansion on the retina known as looming, which in theory exactly specifies the time-to-collision (TTC) of approaching objects. It was recently demonstrated that the affective content of looming stimuli influences perceived TTC, with threatening objects judged as approaching sooner than non-threatening objects. Here, the neural mechanisms by which perceived threat modulates spatiotemporal perception were investigated. Participants judged the TTC of threatening (snakes, spiders) or non-threatening (butterflies, rabbits) stimuli, which expanded in size at a rate indicating one of five TTCs. Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) and oscillatory neural responses measured with electroencephalography were analysed. The arrival time of threatening stimuli was underestimated compared with non-threatening stimuli, though an interaction suggested that this underestimation was not constant across TTCs. Further, both speed of approach and threat modulated both VEPs and oscillatory responses. Speed of approach modulated the N1 parietal and oscillations in the beta band. Threat modulated several VEP components (P1, N1 frontal, N1 occipital, early posterior negativity and late positive potential) and oscillations in the alpha and high gamma band. The results for the high gamma band suggest an interaction between these two factors. Previous evidence suggests that looming stimuli activate sensorimotor areas, even in the absence of an intended action. The current results show that threat disrupts the synchronization over the sensorimotor areas that are likely activated by the presentation of a looming stimulus.},

abstract = {Evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs) are assumed to be generated by outer hair cells (OHCs). It is now generally accepted that EOAEs represent a means of functional exploration of the active micromechanical properties of OHCs. Efferent fibers of the medial olivocochlear system (MOCS) are connected along the sides and the bases of OHCs. Some studies have shown that a suppression effect on EOAE amplitude is induced by the MOCS neurons during contralateral stimulation, presumably by modification of OHC motility. The contralateral acoustic stimuli used in experiments on the EOAE suppression effect have consisted mainly of sounds without a slow temporal fluctuation in their envelopes (broad-band noise, narrow-band noise, pure tones, or clicks). To elucidate further the parameters of MOCS activation, in the present study we looked at the contralateral suppression effect of amplitude-modulated (AM) tones. The results showed that EOAE amplitude was reduced with AM tones compared with no contralateral acoustic stimulation. The suppression effect mainly depended on three parameters. 1) Contralateral stimulation intensity: EOAE suppression occurred only with intensities > or = 40 dB SL. 2) The greater the modulation depth, the greater the suppression effect: statistical analysis showed a significant effect for 75 and 100% modulation depth. 3) The 100- and 140-Hz modulation frequencies gave the greatest suppression effect for 100 and 75% modulation depths. The suppression effect was frequency specific. The greatest decreases were observed when the carrier frequency of the contralateral AM tone was close to the frequency of the EOAE under study, i.e., 1 and 2 kHz. Acoustic cross talk and middle ear effects, which cannot be completely excluded, are discussed. However, the demonstrated frequency specificity of the EOAE suppression effect, together with observed presence of contralateral EOAE suppression in patients without stapedial reflex and the very weak intensities used (i.e., below acoustic reflex threshold), suggested that it was unlikely that the observed effects were due merely to middle ear reflexes. Our results confirm further the contralateral suppression effect on human cochlea mechanisms and show that the suppression effect can be influenced by amplitude modulations of the suppressor, characteristic of sounds in the environment.},

abstract = {Infants are often spoken to in the presence of background sounds, including speech from other talkers. In the present study, we compared 5- and 8.5-month-olds' abilities to recognize their own names in the context of three different types of background speech: that of a single talker, multitalker babble, and that of a single talker played backward. Infants recognized their names at a 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio in the multiple-voice condition but not in the single-voice (nonreversed) condition, a pattern opposite to that of typical adult performance. Infants similarly failed to recognize their names when the background talker's voice was reversed--that is, unintelligible, but with speech-like acoustic properties. These data suggest that infants may have difficulty segregating the components of different speech streams when those streams are acoustically too similar. Alternatively, infants' attention may be drawn to the time-varying acoustic properties associated with a single talker's speech, causing difficulties when a single talker is the competing sound.},

This disorder is typically labelled specific language impairment. Children diagnosed with specific language impairment often have accompanying reading difficulties (dyslexia), but not all children with reading difficulties have specific language impairment. Some researchers claim that language impairment arises from failures specific to language or cognitive processing. Others hold that language impairment results from a more elemental problem that makes affected children unable to hear the acoustic distinctions among successive brief sounds in speech. Here we report the results of psychophysical tests employing simple tones and noises showing that children with specific language impairment have severe auditory perceptual deficits for brief but not long tones in particular sound contexts. Our data support the view that language difficulties result from problems in auditory perception, and provide further information about the nature of these perceptual problems that should contribute to improving the diagnosis and treatment of language impairment and related disorders.},

abstract = {Suppression of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions was recorded from 29 members of the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra and 28 non-musician control subjects matched for age and gender. Binaural broad band noise was used as the suppressor stimulus in a forward masking paradigm. Results showed musicians to have significantly more suppression than non-musicians for both the right and left ears. Two possible explanations for this functional difference between groups are that moderately loud music serves as a sound conditioning stimulus and that music can be a mechanism for strengthening central auditory pathways which may influence the olivocochlear reflex arc. Possible explanations for this are discussed and ear, gender, and age differences within each group are examined. Additionally, middle-ear muscle reflex thresholds were found to be higher in musicians than non-musicians at some frequencies in some conditions.},

abstract = {The latency, the rise time and the influence of the acoustic reflex on sound transmission were investigated in the adult rat during ketamin anesthesia. This was done by recordings of the cochlear microphonics (CM) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the reflex responses of the tensor tympani muscle. The acoustic reflex was elicited by contralateral acoustic stimuli of which the intensity and frequency was varied. Ipsilaterally, the effect on sound transmission was determined by estimating the change in amplitude of the CM's of ipsilateral administered subliminal stimuli. It was shown that both the tensor tympani muscle and the stapedius muscle contribute in the reflex. The latency as well as the rise time of the reflex determined by CM recordings showed to be short (minimal values: 12 and 7 ms respectively). The mean latency of the tensor tympani muscle reflex, measured by EMG, was about 7 ms. The attenuation of 0.25-8 kHz tone bursts upto 115 dB SPL is limited to a mean maximum of 15 dB SPL. The maximal attenuation was shown to occur at 1 kHz. Frequencies above 2 kHz appeared to be the best elicitor of the middle ear muscle reflex.},

abstract = {The click-evoked otoacoustic emission (CEOAE) level-curve grows linearly for clicks below 40-60 dB and saturates for higher inputs. This study investigates dynamic (i.e., time-dependent) features of the CEOAE level-curve by presenting a suppressor-click less than 8 ms before the test-click. An alteration of the CEOAE level-curve, designated here as temporal suppression, was observed within this time period, and was shown to depend on the levels and the temporal separation of the two clicks. Temporal suppression occurred for all four subjects tested, and resulted in a vertical offset from the unsuppressed level-curve for test-click levels greater than 50 dB peak-equivalent level (peSPL). Temporal suppression was greatest for suppressors presented 1-4 ms before the test click, and the magnitude and time scale of the effect were subject dependent. Temporal suppression was furthermore observed for the short- (i.e., 6-18 ms) and long-latency (i.e., 24-36 ms) regions of the CEOAE, indicating that temporal suppression similarly affects synchronized spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SSOAEs) and purely evoked CEOAE components. Overall, this study demonstrates that temporal suppression of the CEOAE level-curve reflects a dynamic process in human cochlear processing that works on a time scale of 0-10 ms.},

abstract = {Some past studies suggest that when sound elements are heard as one object, the spatial cues in the component elements are integrated to determine perceived location, and that this integration is reduced when the elements are perceived in separate objects. The current study explored how object localization depends on the spatial, spectral, and temporal configurations of sound elements in an auditory scene. Localization results are interpreted in light of results from a series of previous experiments studying perceptual grouping of the same stimuli, e.g., Shinn-Cunningham et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 12223-12227 (2007)]. The current results suggest that the integration (pulling) of spatial information across spectrally interleaved elements is obligatory when these elements are simultaneous, even though past results show that these simultaneous sound elements are not grouped strongly into a single perceptual object. In contrast, perceptually distinct objects repel (push) each other spatially with a strength that decreases as the temporal separation between competing objects increases. These results show that the perceived location of an attended object is not easily predicted by knowledge of how sound elements contribute to the perceived spectro-temporal content of that object.},

abstract = {Inner ear efferent neurons are part of a descending centrifugal pathway from the hindbrain known across vertebrates as the octavolateralis efferent system. This centrifugal pathway terminates on either sensory hair cells or eighth nerve ganglion cells. Most studies of efferent development have used either avian or mammalian models. Recent studies suggest that prevailing notions of the development of efferent innervation need to be revised. In birds, efferents reside in a single, diffuse nucleus, but segregate according to vestibular or cochlear projections. In mammals, the auditory and vestibular efferents are completely separate. Cochlear efferents can be divided into at least two distinct, descending medial and lateral pathways. During development, inner ear efferents appear to be a specific motor neuron phenotype, but unlike motor neurons have contralateral projections, innervate sensory targets, and, at least in mammals, also express noncholinergic neurotransmitters. Contrary to prevailing views, newer data suggest that medial efferent neurons mature early, are mostly, if not exclusively, cholinergic, and project transiently to the inner hair cell region of the cochlea before making final synapses on outer hair cells. On the other hand, lateral efferent neurons mature later, are neurochemically heterogeneous, and project mostly, but not exclusively to the inner hair cell region. The early efferent innervation to the ear may serve an important role in the maturation of afferent responses. This review summarizes recent data on the neurogenesis, pathfinding, target selection, innervation, and onset of neurotransmitter expression in cholinergic efferent neurons.},

abstract = {Sensory environments are known to shape nervous system organization. Here we show that passive long-term exposure to a spectrally enhanced acoustic environment (EAE) causes reorganization of the tonotopic map in juvenile cat auditory cortex without inducing any hearing loss. The EAE consisted of tone pips of 32 different frequencies (5-20 kHz), presented in random order at an average rate of 96 Hz. The EAE caused a strong reduction of the representation of EAE frequencies and an over-representation of frequencies neighboring those of the EAE. This is in sharp contrast with earlier developmental studies showing an enlargement of the cortical representation of EAEs consisting of a narrow frequency band. We observed fewer than normal appropriately tuned short-latency responses to EAE frequencies, together with more common long-latency responses tuned to EAE-neighboring frequencies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The main purpose of the study was to measure thresholds for interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs) for acoustically presented noise signals in adults with bilateral cochlear implants (CIs). A secondary purpose was to assess the correlation between the ILD and ITD thresholds and error scores in a horizontal-plane localization task, to test the hypothesis that localization by individuals with bilateral implants is mediated by the processing of ILD cues.

DESIGN:Eleven adults, all postlingually deafened and all bilaterally fitted with MED-EL COMBI 40+ CIs, were tested in ITD and ILD discrimination tasks in which signals were presented acoustically through headphones that fit over their two devices. The stimulus was a 200-msec burst of Gaussian noise bandpass filtered from 100 to 4000 Hz. A two-interval forced-choice adaptive procedure was used in which the subject had to respond on each trial whether the lateral positions of the two sound images (with the interaural difference favoring the left and right sides in the two intervals) moved from left-to-right or right-to-left.

RESULTS:In agreement with previously reported data, ITD thresholds for the subjects with bilateral implants were poor. The best threshold was approximately 400 microsec, and only five of 11 subjects tested achieved thresholds <1000 microsec. In contrast, ILD thresholds were relatively good; mean threshold was 3.8 dB with the initial compression circuit on the implant devices activated and 1.9 dB with the compression deactivated. The ILD and ITD thresholds were higher than previously reported thresholds obtained with direct electrical stimulation (generally, <1.0 dB and 100 to 200 microsec, respectively). When the data from two outlying subjects were omitted, ILD thresholds were highly correlated with total error score in a horizontal-plane localization task, computed for sources near midline (r = 0.87, p < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS:The higher ILD and ITD thresholds obtained in this study with acoustically presented signals (when compared with prior data with direct electrical stimulation) can be attributed-at least partially-to the signal processing carried out by the CI in the former case. The processing strategy effectively leaves only envelope information as a basis for ITD discrimination, which, for the acoustically presented noise stimuli, is mainly coded in the onset information. The operation of the compression circuit reduces the ILDs in the signal, leading to elevated ILD thresholds for the acoustically presented signals in this condition. The large magnitude of the ITD thresholds indicates that ITDs could not have contributed to the performance in the horizontal-plane localization task. Overall, the results suggest that for subjects using bilateral implants, localization of noise signals is mediated entirely by ILD cues, with little or no contribution from ITD information.},

abstract = {Evoked and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions were recorded bilaterally in a group of normal subjects (n = 14) using clicks and tonebursts at four frequencies (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 3 kHz). All ears (n = 28) demonstrated evoked emissions, but not to every stimulus type. The 0.5-kHz toneburst evoked emissions in only 10 (36%) ears, the 1.5-kHz toneburst in all ears, and the remaining stimuli in at least 80% of ears. Two distinct patterns of evoked emissions were identified. Five (18%) ears showed short, broadband click-evoked emissions lasting less than 20 ms after stimulus onset. In these ears, toneburst-evoked emissions were often more prominent than click-evoked emissions and no spontaneous emissions were detected. Twenty-three (82%) ears showed click-evoked emissions lasting longer than 20 ms poststimulus onset. Spectral analysis of these emissions demonstrated several (2-10) narrow frequency peaks. Highly similar peaks were present in the spectra of toneburst-evoked emissions within the range of toneburst spectra. Spontaneous emissions were recorded in 12 of the 23 ears. In these ears, at the frequencies of spontaneous emissions, prominent peaks in both click- and toneburst-evoked emission spectra were always present. Otoacoustic emission characteristics correlated significantly between the ears of individual subjects inferring that a symmetrical cochlear mechanism generates otoacoustic emissions.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of reverberation and noise on the precedence effect in listeners with hearing loss. Lag burst thresholds (LBTs) for 4-ms noise bursts were obtained for 2 groups of participants: impaired hearing and normal hearing. Data were collected in reverberant and anechoic environments in quiet and noise, at sensation levels of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 dB. Results indicated a significant effect of reverberation on LBTs for both participant groups. LBTs increased with sensation level in the reverberant environment and decreased with increasing sensation level in the anechoic environment. There was no effect of hearing loss on LBTs. When the change in LBT due to noise was compared, the effect of noise depended on group and environment, with a greater effect of noise on the performance of listeners with impaired hearing. It is likely that the ability to fuse direct sounds and early reflections is degraded in listeners with impaired hearing and that this contributes to the difficulties experienced by these listeners in reverberation and noise.},

abstract = {Previous studies of animals observed a phenomenon of adaptation of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and found that the phenomenon was mediated to a large extent by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. The present study investigated DPOAE adaptation in humans. The following stimuli were used: f2/f1 = 1.2; f2 = 2, 4, or 5.65 kHz; L2 = 50-65 dB SPL re 20 microPa rms, L1 - L2 = 0-15 dB, where L1 and L2 represent levels of the f1 and f2 tones, respectively; duration of two-tone burst = 5.5 s; interburst gap = 20 or 30 s; number of repetitions = 40 or 64. We analyzed the 2f1 - f2 DPOAE as a function of time using a method of heterodyne envelope detection. The subjects were 20 humans aged from 15 to 54 years (median = 21 years) with normal hearing. We observed that (1) humans exhibited DPOAE adaptation phenomenon; (2) the time course of DPOAE level was characterized by a 2-exponential function; (3) distributions of the fast and slow time constants were well separated with their median values being 69 ms and 1.51 s, respectively; (4) distributions of the magnitudes of the fast and slow adaptation components were largely overlapped with their median values being 0.65 and 0.40 dB, respectively; and (5) the combined magnitude of the adaptation ranged from 0.4 to 3.0 dB with a median of 1.10 dB. To our knowledge, the present study is the first published article to describe adaptation of DPOAE in humans. These results should help advance the basic knowledge of human cochlear mechanics operating under the control of the MOC feedback system and contribute to the development of practical applications such as identifying people at high risk of acoustical injury and a clinical test of the functional status of the MOC system.},

abstract = {Activation of ipsilaterally responsive olivocochlear (OC) neurons by sound produces rapid, post-onset alterations in the 2f1-f2 distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). The present study investigates the frequency and level dependence of this ipsilateral OC effect in the anesthetized guinea pig, compares its magnitude and sign to OC effects elicited by contralateral sound ("contralateral" OC effect), and characterizes the influence of such activity on steady-state DPOAE amplitude. DPOAEs were measured with fine time resolution in response to primary stimuli varied systematically in frequency and level. DPOAEs showed rapid and remarkably stereotyped post-onset amplitude alterations. These ipsilateral OC effects were greater for high (8-12 kHz) than for low (2-4 kHz) f2 primary frequencies and for higher primary levels (70-80 dB SPL). For any f2/f1 pair, the sign as well as the magnitude of the ipsilateral effects varied with. primary level ratio. For example, with L1 fixed at 75 and L2 varied in 1-dB steps from 60 to 75 dB SPL, DPOAE amplitude underwent a stereotyped progression from post-onset increases at the lowest levels of the f2 primary to post-onset decreases at the highest levels. At intermediate levels, near the region of sign change (L2 = 5-10 dB below L1), post-onset effects were often particularly large (as great as 20 dB). These large ipsilateral OC effects were always associated with "dips" in the DPOAE amplitude vs. level functions, and both disappeared after OC section. Although smaller in magnitude, contralateral OC effects were identical to ipsilateral effects in frequency and level dependence and in form.},

Therefore, a new framework for describing the acoustic structure of speech based purely on temporal aspects has been developed. From this point of view, speech can be said to be comprised of three main temporal features, based on dominant fluctuation rates: envelope, periodicity, and fine-structure. Each feature has distinct acoustic manifestations, auditory and perceptual correlates, and roles in linguistic contrasts. The applicability of this three-featured temporal system is discussed in relation to hearing-impaired and normal listeners.},

abstract = {Contralateral masking is the phenomenon where a masker presented to one ear affects the ability to detect a signal in the opposite ear. For normal hearing listeners, contralateral masking results in masking patterns that are both sharper and dramatically smaller in magnitude than ipsilateral masking. The goal of this study was to investigate whether medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents are needed for the sharpness and relatively small magnitude of the contralateral masking function. To do this, bilateral cochlear implant patients were tested because, by directly stimulating the auditory nerve, cochlear implants circumvent the effects of the MOC efferents. The results indicated that, as with normal hearing listeners, the contralateral masking function was sharper than the ipsilateral masking function. However, although there was a reduction in the magnitude of the contralateral masking function compared to the ipsilateral masking function, it was relatively modest. This is in sharp contrast to the results of normal hearing listeners where the magnitude of the contralateral masking function is greatly reduced. These results suggest that MOC function may not play a large role in the sharpness of the contralateral masking function but may play a considerable role in the magnitude of the contralateral masking function.},

abstract = {We confirm the report of Mountain (Mountain, D.C. (1980): Science 210, 77-72) that stimulating the crossed olivocochlear bundle (COCB) can change the magnitude of the distortion product (f2-f1) in the ear-canal sound pressure. Our results are extended to include (2f1-f2) as well as (f2-f1) from anesthetized chinchillas with both middle-ear muscles sectioned. In contrast to Mountain's report, the polarity of the change can be either positive, negative or absent, depending on the choice of two-tone stimulus frequencies. The influence of two-tone stimulus level is also complex, but we have not yet seen the polarity of the COCB effect change with stimulus level. The magnitude and polarity of the change in (2f1-f2) are not simply related to those for (f2-f1). The effect of COCB stimulation is abolished when scala tympani is perfused with artificial perilymph containing 10(-5) M d-tubocurarine. These results demonstrate that the COCB effect is postsynaptic, probably mediated by outer hair cells. We suggest that the normal cochlea contains an active biomechanical mechanism which reduces the damping of the cochlear-partition motion and is modulated by activating the efferents. It is thus possible that the central nervous system may be able to control the dynamics of the motion of the cochlear partition.},

abstract = {Reduced frequency selectivity associated with sensorineural hearing loss may pose particular problems for hearing-impaired listeners in noisy environments. In these situations, broader-than-normal auditory filters may affect the perception of speech by reducing the contrast between spectral peaks and valleys in at least two ways. First, the peaks and valleys in the internal representation of the speech spectrum become smeared, resulting in less precise frequency analysis. Second, there may be a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at the output of each auditory filter. In order to examine the relationship between frequency selectivity and identification of speechlike stimuli in noise, hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners were trained to assign vowel labels to four harmonic complexes which differed in the frequency locations of four elevated ("peak") harmonics. Peak harmonics were chosen to approximate first- and second-formant frequencies in four English vowels. Listeners were then tested to determine the spectral contrast necessary between peak and background components in order to maintain identification accuracy in the presence of various levels of broadband noise. Results indicated that for these stimuli, normal-hearing listeners required about 1 dB of additional spectral contrast for every doubling of the intensity of noise. The required increase in spectral contrast was generally greater for listeners with broader-than-normal auditory filters at 2000 Hz. This finding suggests indirectly that in the internal representations of speech sounds embedded in noise, the signal-to-noise ratio for listeners with abnormal frequency selectivity is poorer than for listeners with normal frequency selectivity. A poorer-than-normal internal S/N may be one factor underlying the common observation that noise often is more degrading to speech understanding by hearing-impaired listeners than by normal-hearing listeners.},

abstract = {Auditory enhancement refers to the perceptual phenomenon that a target sound is heard out more readily from a background sound if the background is presented alone first. Here we used stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) to test the hypothesis that activation of the medial olivocochlear efferent system contributes to auditory enhancement effects. The SFOAEs were used as a tool to measure changes in cochlear responses to a target component and the neighboring components of a multitone background between conditions producing enhancement and conditions producing no enhancement. In the "enhancement" condition, the target and multitone background were preceded by a precursor stimulus with a spectral notch around the signal frequency; in the control (no-enhancement) condition, the target and multitone background were presented without the precursor. In an experiment using a wideband multitone stimulus known to produce significant psychophysical enhancement effects, SFOAEs showed no changes consistent with enhancement, but some aspects of the results indicated possible contamination of the SFOAE magnitudes by the activation of the middle-ear-muscle reflex. The same SFOAE measurements performed using narrower-band stimuli at lower sound levels also showed no SFOAE changes consistent with either absolute or relative enhancement despite robust psychophysical enhancement effects observed in the same listeners with the same stimuli. The results suggest that cochlear efferent control does not play a significant role in auditory enhancement effects.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that the Digit Span (DS) subtest and component tasks (Wechsler, 1991) would show strong relationships with a dichotic listening test (Musiek, 1983). In two sets of archival clinical data (N = 74 and N = 51) we demonstrated that: (a) individuals with central auditory deficits had lower DS scores, F(1, 72) = 7.34, p = .008; eta2 = .09; and (b) left-ear dichotic deficits impacted forward span, F(2, 48) = 8.45, p = .001. Right-ear dichotic listening performance also accounted for significant variance in digit forward span (R2 = 0.17, p = .003). While limited in scope, the studies conclude that forward but not reverse span performance is strongly related to dichotic listening, and can serve as a marker for possible central auditory deficits.},

abstract = {Mutations in genes encoding tectorial membrane (TM) proteins are a significant cause of human hereditary hearing loss (Hildebrand et al. 2011), and several mouse models have been developed to study the functional significance of this accessory structure in the mammalian cochlea. In this study, we use otoacoustic emissions (OAE), signals obtained from the ear canal that provide a measure of cochlear function, to characterize a mouse in which the TM is detached from the spiral limbus due to an absence of otoancorin (Otoa, Lukashkin et al. 2012). Our results demonstrate that spontaneous emissions (SOAE), sounds produced in the cochlea without stimulation, increase dramatically in mice with detached TMs even though their hearing sensitivity is reduced. This behavior is unusual because wild-type (WT) controls are rarely spontaneous emitters. SOAEs in mice lacking Otoa predominate around 7~kHz, which is much lower than in either WT animals when they generate SOAEs or in mutant mice in which the TM protein Ceacam16 is absent (Cheatham et al. 2014). Although both mutants lack Hensen's stripe, loss of this TM feature is only observed in regions coding frequencies greater than {\textasciitilde}15~kHz in WT mice so its loss cannot explain the low-frequency, de novo SOAEs observed in mice lacking Otoa. The fact that {\textasciitilde}80~% of mice lacking Otoa produce SOAEs even when they generate smaller distortion product OAEs suggests that the active process is still functioning in these mutants but the system(s) involved have become less stable due to alterations in TM structure.},

P300 amplitude was larger over the right compared to left hemisphere electrode sites primarily at anterior-medial locations (F3/4, C3/4) for both target and standard stimuli. The N100, P200, and N200 components also demonstrated several similar, albeit less robust, hemispheric asymmetries. No hemispheric effects for P300 latency were observed, with few consistent latency findings for any of the other components obtained. The results suggest that the discrimination process underlying P300 generation may originate with right frontal activation.},

abstract = {To advance our understanding of the biological basis of speech-in-noise perception, we investigated the effects of background noise on both subcortical- and cortical-evoked responses, and the relationships between them, in normal hearing young adults. The addition of background noise modulated subcortical and cortical response morphology. In noise, subcortical responses were later, smaller in amplitude and demonstrated decreased neural precision in encoding the speech sound. Cortical responses were also delayed by noise, yet the amplitudes of the major peaks (N1, P2) were affected differently, with N1 increasing and P2 decreasing. Relationships between neural measures and speech-in-noise ability were identified, with earlier subcortical responses, higher subcortical response fidelity and greater cortical N1 response magnitude all relating to better speech-in-noise perception. Furthermore, it was only with the addition of background noise that relationships between subcortical and cortical encoding of speech and the behavioral measures of speech in noise emerged. Results illustrate that human brainstem responses and N1 cortical response amplitude reflect coordinated processes with regards to the perception of speech in noise, thereby acting as a functional index of speech-in-noise perception.},

abstract = {Although many researchers have examined the role that binaural cues play in the perception of spatially separated speech signals, relatively little is known about the cues that listeners use to segregate competing speech messages in a monaural or diotic stimulus. This series of experiments examined how variations in the relative levels and voice characteristics of the target and masking talkers influence a listener's ability to extract information from a target phrase in a 3-talker or 4-talker diotic stimulus. Performance in this speech perception task decreased systematically when the level of the target talker was reduced relative to the masking talkers. Performance also generally decreased when the target and masking talkers had similar voice characteristics: the target phrase was most intelligible when the target and masking phrases were spoken by different-sex talkers, and least intelligible when the target and masking phrases were spoken by the same talker. However, when the target-to-masker ratio was less than 3 dB, overall performance was usually lower with one different-sex masker than with all same-sex maskers. In most of the conditions tested, the listeners performed better when they were exposed to the characteristics of the target voice prior to the presentation of the stimulus. The results of these experiments demonstrate how monaural factors may play an important role in the segregation of speech signals in multitalker environments.},

abstract = {The present results are drawn from preliminary observations made in 28 patients suffering from unilateral, permanent, non-pulsatile tinnitus, who were systematically submitted to an investigation of their otoacoustic emissions in both ears. Spontaneous otoemissions (SOAE) were carefully looked for, before recording of transient evoked otoemissions (TEOAE). The effectiveness of the medial olivo-cochlear efferent system (MOC) was also tested. The comparison between TEOAE input/output curves obtained with and without contralateral stimulation allowed a global assessment of the functioning of MOC. Additional information relating to the MOC functioning at the precise frequency of tinnitus and/or around it, was available from the comparison of analogous curves obtained using distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) instead of TEOAEs. The results show that: (1) when the amplitude of otoacoustic emissions differs between the two ears, the tinnitus is generally lateralized on the side where amplitude was the lowest, which seems to be related to a greater hearing loss; (2) no general law concerning tinnitus can be drawn from the global testing of MOC functioning; the only result is that the slope of TEOAE input/output function appears as a deciding factor for efficiency of MOC, the least efficiency almost always occurring on the side where the slope is greater, and (3) even in the case of proved global effectiveness of MOC activation, there is, at least in the vicinity and in at least one ear, a part of the cochlea where its functioning is altered. A better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying this symptom will probably come from exhaustive exploration of individual cases rather than a rougher investigation of large samples in which different aetiologies are likely to be mixed.},

abstract = {The effect of spatial separation of sources on the masking of a speech signal was investigated for three types of maskers, ranging from energetic to informational. Normal-hearing listeners performed a closed-set speech identification task in the presence of a masker at various signal-to-noise ratios. Stimuli were presented in a quiet sound field. The signal was played from 0 degrees azimuth and a masker was played either from the same location or from 90 degrees to the right. Signals and maskers were derived from sentences that were preprocessed by a modified cochlear-implant simulation program that filtered each sentence into 15 frequency bands, extracted the envelopes from each band, and used these envelopes to modulate pure tones at the center frequencies of the bands. In each trial, the signal was generated by summing together eight randomly selected frequency bands from the preprocessed signal sentence. Three maskers were derived from the preprocessed masker sentences: (1) different-band sentence, which was generated by summing together six randomly selected frequency bands out of the seven bands not present in the signal (resulting in primarily informational masking); (2) different-band noise, which was generated by convolving the different-band sentence with Gaussian noise; and (3) same-band noise, which was generated by summing the same eight bands from the preprocessed masker sentence that were used in the signal sentence and convolving the result with Gaussian noise (resulting in primarily energetic masking). Results revealed that in the different-band sentence masker, the effect of spatial separation averaged 18 dB (at 51% correct), while in the different-band and same-band noise maskers the effect was less than 10 dB. These results suggest that, in these conditions, the advantage due to spatial separation of sources is greater for informational masking than for energetic masking.},

abstract = {A model for the generation of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and frequency following responses (FFRs) is presented. The model is based on the concept introduced by Goldstein and Kiang [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 30, 107-114 (1958)] that evoked potentials recorded at remote electrodes can theoretically be given by convolution of an elementary unit waveform (unitary response) with the instantaneous discharge rate function for the corresponding unit. In the present study, the nonlinear computational auditory-nerve model recently developed by Heinz et al. [ARLO 2(3), 91-96 (2001)] was used to calculate the instantaneous discharge rate ri(t) for fibers i in the frequency range from 0.1 and 10 kHz. The summed activity across frequency was convolved with a unitary response which is assumed to reflect contributions from different cell populations within the auditory brainstem, recorded at a given pair of electrodes on the scalp. Predicted potential patterns are compared with experimental data for a number of stimulus and level conditions. Clicks, chirps as defined in Dau et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 107, 1530-1540 (2000)], long-duration stimuli comprising the chirp, as well as tones and slowly varying tonal sweeps were considered. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of the basilar-membrane traveling wave and auditory-nerve processing for the formation of ABR and FFR. Specifically, the results support the hypothesis that the FFR to low-frequency tones represents synchronized activity mainly stemming from mid- and high-frequency units at more basal sites, and not from units tuned to frequencies around the signal frequency.},

abstract = {Temporal auditory acuity, the ability to discriminate rapid changes in the envelope of a sound, is essential for speech comprehension. Human envelope following responses (EFRs) recorded from scalp electrodes were evaluated as an objective measurement of temporal processing in the auditory nervous system. The temporal auditory acuity of older and younger participants was measured behaviorally using both gap and modulation detection tasks. These findings were then related to EFRs evoked by white noise that was amplitude modulated (25% modulation depth) with a sweep of modulation frequencies from 20 to 600 Hz. The frequency at which the EFR was no longer detectable was significantly correlated with behavioral measurements of gap detection (r = -0.43), and with the maximum perceptible modulation frequency (r = 0.72). The EFR techniques investigated here might be developed into a clinically useful objective estimate of temporal auditory acuity for subjects who cannot provide reliable behavioral responses.},

abstract = {The relationship between hearing loss, detected by measuring the audiometric threshold shift, and the presence of long-lasting otoacoustic emissions, has been studied in a population of 66 adult males, by analyzing the cochlear response in the 80 ms following the subministration of a click stimulus. Most long-lasting OAEs are also recognizable as Synchronized Spontaneous OAEs (SSOAEs). The OAE characteristic decay times were evaluated according to the model by Sisto and Moleti [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 106, 1893 (1999)]. The starting hypothesis, confirmed by the results, is that long decay time and large equilibrium amplitude are both manifestations of the effectiveness of the active feedback mechanism. The prevalence and frequency distribution of long-lasting OAEs, and of their SSOAE subset, have been separately analyzed for normal and impaired ears. No long-lasting OAE was found within the hearing loss frequency range, but several were found in impaired ears outside the hearing loss range, both at lower and higher frequencies. This result suggests that the correlation between the presence of long-lasting OAEs and good cochlear functionality be local in the frequency domain. The monitor of the OAE decay time is proposed as a new possible method for early detecting hearing loss in populations exposed to noise.},

abstract = {The sound localization ability of human observers has been frequently examined in quiet environments, but there have been relatively few studies that have considered the effect of noise on sound localization. In this study, three subjects judged the perceived direction of broadband click-train signal in the quiet and in the presence of a broadband noise at nine signal-to-noise ratios, which varied over a 23 dB range. The signal could originate from any of 239 spatial locations that completely surrounded the subjects in azimuth 360 degrees) and ranged from -45 degrees to (+)90 degrees in elevation; the masker (when present) was always located directly in front of the subjects at 0 degrees azimuth and 0 degree elevation. The subjects indicated the perceived direction of the signal by pointing at a 20-cm-diam spherical model of auditory space. As the signal-to-noise ratio was lowered, the accuracy of localization judgments decreased nearly monotonically. However, the accuracy of judgments relative to the median plane (i.e., the left/right dimension) was less strongly influenced by the presence of noise than was the accuracy of judgments relative to the horizontal plane (i.e., the up/down dimension). The accuracy of judgments relative to the frontal plane (i.e., the front/back dimension) was most strongly influenced by noise.},

abstract = {Click evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) are commonly used both in research and clinics to assay the medial olivocochlear system (MOC). Clicks presented at rates >50 Hz in the contralateral ear have previously been reported to evoke contralateral MOC activity. However, in typical MOC assays, clicks are presented in the ipsilateral ear in conjunction with MOC elicitor (noise) in the contralateral ear. The effect of click rates in such an arrangement is currently unknown. A forward masking paradigm was used to emulate typical MOC assays to elucidate the influence of ipsilateral click presentation rates on MOC inhibition of CEOAEs in 28 normal hearing adults. Influence of five click rates (20.83, 25, 31.25, 41.67, and 62.5 Hz) presented at 55 dB peSPL was tested. Results indicate that click rates as low as 31.25 Hz significantly enhance contralateral MOC inhibition, pos- sibly through the activation of ipsilateral and binaural MOC neurons with potential contributions from the middle ear muscle reflex. Therefore, click rates 􏰧25 Hz are recommended for use in MOC assays, at least for 55 dB peSPL click level. },

abstract = {An extensive physiological literature, including experimental and clinical studies in humans, demonstrates that activation of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system, by either contralateral sound or electrical stimulation, can produce significant alterations in cochlear function and suggests a role for the MOC system in influencing the auditory behavior of binaural hearing. The present data are from psychophysical studies in nonhuman primates which seek to determine if the noted physiological changes in response to contralateral acoustic stimulation have a perceptual counterpart. Four juvenile Japanese macaques were trained to respond to the presence of 1-s sinusoids, presented to the test ear, in an operant reinforcement paradigm. Thresholds were compared for frequencies ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 kHz in quiet, with thresholds measured when continuous, two octave-band noise, centered on the test tone frequency, was presented in the contralateral ear. Contralateral noise was presented at levels of 10-60 dB above detection threshold for the test-tone frequency. While some variability was evident across subjects, both in the frequency distribution and magnitude (as a function of contralateral noise level), all subjects exhibited an increase, or suppression of thresholds in the presence of contralateral noise. On average, thresholds increased systematically with contralateral noise level, to a peak of 7 dB. In one subject, the threshold increase seen with contralateral noise was significantly reduced when the MOC was surgically sectioned on the floor of the IVth ventricle. The characteristics of the measured shifts in behavioral thresholds, in the presence of contralateral noise reported here, are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to both efferent physiological suppression effects and psychophysical central masking threshold shifts which have been reported previously. These data suggest that at least some aspects of "central masking" are efferent-mediated peripheral processes, and that the term "central masking" may be incorrect.},

To circumvent confounds due to inter-individual anatomical variation, we defined our subjects' Heschl's gyri and assessed blood oxygenation-dependent signal changes at 3 T within this confined region during visual speech perception and observation of moving circles. Visual speech perception activated Heschl's gyri in nine subjects, with activation in seven of them extending to the area of primary auditory cortex. Activation was significantly stronger during visual speech perception than during observation of the moving circles. Further, a significant hemisphere by stimulus interaction occurred, suggesting left Heschl's gyrus specialization for visual speech processing.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:"Dead regions" are regions in the cochlea with no functioning inner hair cells (IHCs) and/or neurons. Amplification (using a hearing aid) over a frequency range corresponding to a dead region may not be beneficial and may even impair speech intelligibility. The objective of this article is to illustrate the use of psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) as a tool for investigating dead regions and to illustrate the variety of audiogram configurations that can be associated with dead regions. We explore the influence of signal level and signal frequency to test the hypothesis that the frequency at the tip of the tuning curve defines the boundary of the dead region.

DESIGN:PTCs were measured for five subjects with sensorineural hearing loss who were suspected of having dead regions. One had a relatively "flat" loss, one had a mild mid-frequency loss and three had high-frequency losses, varying in severity from 70 dB to more than 120 dB. For each PTC, the level and frequency of the sinusoidal signal were fixed, and the level of a narrowband noise masker needed just to mask the signal was determined as a function of the masker frequency. When the signal falls in a frequency region that is not "dead," the signal is detected via IHCs with characteristic frequencies (CFs) at or close to the signal frequency. In such a case, the tip of the PTC (the masker frequency at which the masker level is lowest) lies at or close to the signal frequency. When a dead region is present, the signal is detected via IHCs with CFs different from that of the signal frequency. In such a case, the tip of the PTC is shifted away from the signal frequency.

RESULTS:PTCs with frequency-shifted tips (indicative of dead regions) were found for all subjects. The frequencies at the tips sometimes decreased slightly with increasing signal level. For the subject with a relatively flat loss, PTCs with tips close to 3000 Hz were obtained for signal frequencies of 400, 1000 and 1500 Hz. A PTC with a tip at 5000 Hz was found for a signal frequency of 6000 Hz. These results suggest that this subject had an "island" of surviving IHCs and neurons with CFs ranging from 3000 to 5000 Hz, with extensive dead regions on either side. For the subject with a mid-frequency loss, the pattern of results suggested a mid-frequency dead region. For the subjects with high-frequency loss, the results suggested the presence of high-frequency dead regions, in one case starting at a frequency where absolute thresholds were only slightly higher than normal.

CONCLUSIONS:PTCs can be used to detect and delimit dead regions. Often, the frequency at the tip of the PTC can be used to define approximately one boundary of the dead region. However, the detection of beats can affect the shape of the PTC around the tip when the signal frequency lies just inside the dead region. The level of the signal can also have some effect on the frequency at the tip of the PTC. Very low signal levels can lead to variable results. Dead regions can start at frequencies where absolute thresholds are near normal.},

abstract = {Medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons are efferent neurons that project axons from the brain to the cochlea. Their action on outer hair cells reduces the gain of the "cochlear amplifier," which shifts the dynamic range of hearing and reduces the effects of noise masking. The MOC effects in one ear can be elicited by sound in that ipsilateral ear or by sound in the contralateral ear. To study how MOC neurons project onto the cochlea to mediate these effects, single-unit labeling in guinea pigs was used to study the mapping of MOC neurons for neurons responsive to ipsilateral sound vs. those responsive to contralateral sound. MOC neurons were sharply tuned to sound frequency with a well-defined characteristic frequency (CF). However, their labeled termination spans in the organ of Corti ranged from narrow to broad, innervating between 14 and 69 outer hair cells per axon in a "patchy" pattern. For units responsive to ipsilateral sound, the midpoint of innervation was mapped according to CF in a relationship generally similar to, but with more variability than, that of auditory-nerve fibers. Thus, based on CF mappings, most of the MOC terminations miss outer hair cells involved in the cochlear amplifier for their CF, which are located more basally. Compared with ipsilaterally responsive neurons, contralaterally responsive neurons had an apical offset in termination and a larger span of innervation (an average of 10.41% cochlear distance), suggesting that when contralateral sound activates the MOC reflex, the actions are different than those for ipsilateral sound.},

abstract = {Auditory system hemispheric asymmetry in language processing is well-established, and there are many indications of lateralization as of the peripheral auditory system i.e., as of the cochlea. The left ear is more susceptible to noise damage; tinnitus is more predominant there, while spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are more often found in the right ear. The present study addressed the following two questions: Does this right-ear SOAE prevalence exist as early as preterm birth? Is there any functional asymmetry in the medial olivo-cochlear (MOC) efferent system, known to modulate outer hair cell contractions? The study involved 483 preterm neonates (gestional age: 24-37 weeks) and 70 right-handed adults (age: 18-31 years). In each ear, SOAEs and evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs) were recorded and analysed, and, for the adults, functional MOC system assessment was made. Results showed SOAEs and EOAE amplitude to be right-predominant and in adults a right MOC functional predominance. These results indicate peripheral auditory system lateralisation, and an early origin thereof.

abstract = {The hypothesis that gamma-band oscillations are related to the representation of an environmental scene in the cerebral cortex after binding of corresponding perceptual elements is currently under discussion. One question is how the sensory system reacts to a fast change in the scene if perceptual elements are rigidly bound together. A reset of the gamma-band oscillation forced by a change in sensory input may dissolve the binding, which then would be re-established for the new sensation. We studied the reset of gamma-band oscillations on the 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) by means of whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG). The rhythm of 40-Hz AM of a 500-Hz tone evoked the ASSR, and a short noise burst served as a concurrent stimulus. Possible direct interactions of the auditory stimuli were excluded by presenting the noise impulse in a different frequency channel (2,000-3,000 Hz) to the contralateral ear. The concurrent stimulus induced a considerable decrement in the amplitude of ASSR, which was localized in primary auditory cortices. This decrement lasted 250 ms and was significantly longer than the duration of the transient gamma-band response evoked by the noise burst. Thus it could not be explained by any linear superimposition of the responses. The time courses of ASSR amplitude and phase during recovery from the decrement resembled those after stimulus onset, indicating that a new ASSR was built up after the resetting stimulus. The results are discussed as reset of oscillations in human thalamocortical networks.},

abstract = {The effects of the addition of contralateral noise on the psychophysical tuning curve (PTC) were examined in subjects with normal hearing. The masking threshold of the tail part of the PTC tended to decrease with the addition of contralateral noise, although the threshold reduction was usually less than 5 dB. On the other hand, the effects of contralateral noise were relatively small around the tip of the PTC contour. Focusing on the effects of contralateral noise on the masking threshold at the tail part of the PTC, the effects of changing the time between initiation of masking the tone and the presentation of the masked probe tone on the threshold reduction at the tail part of the PTC were also observed. The results indicate that the reduction of the masking threshold by the addition of contralateral noise tended to be larger when the presentation of the signal tone was delayed after the onset of the masker. Usually, when the signal tone was presented under conditions of the forward masking paradigm, the reduction of the threshold was most remarkable. Results obtained in the present study are discussed based on the known characteristics of the olivocochlear (OC)-efferent fibers activated by contralateral noise.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:This article examines whether changes in hearing screening practices are warranted based on the results of the recent series of studies by J. L. Johnson, K. R. White, J. E. Widen, J. S. Gravel, B. R. Vohr, M. James, T. Kennalley, A. B. Maxon, L. Spivak, M. Sullivan-Mahoney, Y. Weirather, and S. Meyer (Johnson, White, Widen, Gravel, James, et al., 2005; Johnson, White, Widen, Gravel, Vohr, et al., 2005; White et al., 2005; Widen et al., 2005) that found a significant number of infants who passed an automated auditory brainstem response (A-ABR) screening after failing an initial otoacoustic emission (OAE) screening later were found to have permanent hearing loss in one or both ears.

METHOD:Similar to the approach used by F. H. Bess and J. Paradise (1994), this article addresses the public health tenets that need to be in place before screening programs, or in this case, a change in screening practice (use of a 2-step screening protocol) can be justified.

RESULTS:There are no data to suggest that a 2-step OAE/A-ABR screening protocol should be avoided.

CONCLUSION:Research is needed before any change in public policy and practice surrounding current early hearing detection and intervention programs could be supported.},

Increases in stimulus intensity produced reliable increases in P300 amplitude and decreases in peak latency for both modalities that were additive with target stimulus probability effects. Similar, somewhat weaker stimulus intensity effects also were observed for the N100, P200, and N200 components. The findings suggest that stimulus intensity contributes to both P300 amplitude and latency measures in important ways and are discussed in relation to the use of ERPs in applied contexts.},

abstract = {The effect of frequency uncertainty on the detection of tonal signals in noise was studied using a modified probe-signal method. Widths of the listening bands used during detection were measured directly, allowing for an analysis that separates the effects of having to monitor multiple independent bands from those due to limited frequency resolution. Uncertainty was varied by beginning each trial with a cue consisting of one, two, or four randomly chosen, simultaneously presented tones. An expected signal, whose frequency matched one of the components in a cue, was presented on a majority of trials. However, on remaining trials, the signal was a probe, which meant that its frequency differed from one of the components in the cue by a constant ratio. Performance as measured in percent correct declined for probes at increasingly distant ratios from the expected values. The results were converted to dB using individual psychometric functions for expected signals and listening bands were fitted using the rounded exponential filter of Patterson et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 72, 1788-1803 (1982)]. The obtained bandwidths are comparable to those reported using notched-noise maskers, but there is a small but consistent increase in bandwidth with increased numbers of components in the cues. The primary results is that the effects due to uncertainty are well described by a 1-of-M orthogonal band model, which takes into consideration limitations of the detector, including the widths of the listening bands.},

abstract = {We attempt to provide evidence that the projection from the guinea pig auditory cortex (AC) to the inferior colliculus (IC) may contain glutamatergic or GABAergic fibers. Seven days after unilateral AC aspiration, histological studies indicated almost complete AC destruction and preterminal degeneration of fibers and terminal fields in the dorsal cortex (DCIC), external cortex (ECIC), and central nucleus (CNIC) of the IC ipsilateral to the ablated AC. Contralaterally, degeneration appeared in the DCIC. AC ablation depressed the electrically evoked Ca(2+)-dependent release of D-[3H]aspartate (D-[3H]Asp) in the ipsilateral DCIC, ECIC, and CNIC, and D-[3H]Asp uptake in the CNIC. Together with other evidence that the corticocollicular pathway is excitatory, these findings suggest that this projection may contain glutamatergic and/or aspartatergic (Glu/Asp-ergic) fibers. Glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactivity was not apparent in presumed pyramidal cells of layer V of the AC retrogradely labeled with biotinylated dextran injected into the ipsilateral IC. Thus, corticocollicular neurons probably do not synthesize GABA and may not be GABAergic. However, AC ablation depressed [14C]GABA release from the ipsilateral DCIC and ECIC, and [14C]GABA uptake in the DCIC. These findings are consistent with the atrophy or down-regulation of some subcortical neurons that mediate GABAergic transmission in the IC.},

abstract = {Children between the ages of 5 and 12 years were tested with dichotic listening tests utilizing single syllable words and random presentations of digits. They produced a higher prevalence of left ear dominance than expected, especially among right-handed children when tested with words. Whether more children demonstrate the LEA because of right hemisphere dominance for language or because there is less stability in ear advantage direction at younger ages cannot be fully resolved by this study. When ear advantages were measured by subtracting each child's lower score from the higher score without regard to right or left direction, an age-related trend toward lower measures of ear advantage was evident. This trend was greater for dichotic words than for dichotic digits. Structural factors that may be related to these results and possible influences of attention and verbal workload on the two kinds of dichotic stimuli are discussed.},

abstract = {A surgical approach to the cat's VIIIth nerve has been developed which allows recordings to be made from efferent fibers of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB) as well as primary afferent fibers, without compromising the acoustic responsiveness of either ear. The designation of OCB fibers as those with regular interspike intervals was confirmed in five cases by intracellular labeling with horseradish peroxidase. Labeled fibers could be traced centrally to somata in the superior olivary complex and peripherally to large endings on outer hair cells. The locations of the labeled neurons are consistent with a classification as cells of the medial olivocochlear system [Warr and Guinan (1979): Brain Res. 173, 152-155]. Within the cochlea, efferent neurons branched profusely to innervate as many as 84 outer hair cells over as much as 2.8 mm of the organ of Corti. Efferent units had tuning curves which were similar to those of primary afferents, although most were somewhat more broadly-tuned than afferents from the same animal. The cochlear region innervated by an efferent neuron was always close to the place where afferent fibers of the same characteristic frequency (CF) would be found. Most efferents (89%) were excited by only one ear and showed no spontaneous activity. Neurons with an ipsilateral response (n = 3) had cell bodies in the contralateral brainstem and vice versa (n = 2). Binaural units (none of which were labeled) often had spontaneous discharge and were generally restricted to low-CF regions. Differences between low- and high-CF units, which cut across the monaural/binaural distinction, were seen in the dynamic range and minimum latency. Interanimal differences seen in the responses of the efferent neurons may be related to differences in the level of anesthesia.},

abstract = {Individuals with developmental language disabilities, including developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI), exhibit impairments in processing rapidly presented auditory stimuli. It has been hypothesized that these deficits are associated with concurrent deficits in speech perception and, in turn, impaired language development. Additionally, postmortem analyses of human dyslexic brains have revealed the presence of focal neocortical malformations such as cerebrocortical microgyria. In an initial study bridging these research domains, we found that male rats with induced microgyria were impaired in discriminating rapidly presented auditory stimuli. In order to further assess this anatomical- behavioral association, we designed two experiments using auditory-reflex modification. These studies were intended to assess whether auditory processing deficits in microgyric male rats would be seen in threshold detection of a silent gap in white noise, and in oddball detection of a two-tone stimulus of variable duration. Results showed no differences between sham and microgyric subjects on gap detection, but did show that microgyric subjects were impaired in the discrimination of two-tone stimuli presented in an oddball paradigm. This impairment was evident for stimuli with total duration of 64 msec or less, while both groups were able to discriminate stimuli with duration of 89 msec or greater. The current results further support the relationship between malformations of the cerebral cortex and deficits in rapid auditory processing. They also suggest that the parameters characterizing rapid auditory processing deficits for a specific task may be influenced by stimulus features and/or cognitive demand of that particular task.},

abstract = {This study examined the role of focused attention along the spatial (azimuthal) dimension in a highly uncertain multitalker listening situation. The task of the listener was to identify key words from a target talker in the presence of two other talkers simultaneously uttering similar sentences. When the listener had no a priori knowledge about target location, or which of the three sentences was the target sentence, performance was relatively poor-near the value expected simply from choosing to focus attention on only one of the three locations. When the target sentence was cued before the trial, but location was uncertain, performance improved significantly relative to the uncued case. When spatial location information was provided before the trial, performance improved significantly for both cued and uncued conditions. If the location of the target was certain, proportion correct identification performance was higher than 0.9 independent of whether the target was cued beforehand. In contrast to studies in which known versus unknown spatial locations were compared for relatively simple stimuli and tasks, the results of the current experiments suggest that the focus of attention along the spatial dimension can play a very significant role in solving the "cocktail party" problem.},

One loudspeaker was positioned at ear level, 0 degree, and four others each were positioned above and below 0 degree. To examine infants' resolution of auditory space in the median vertical plane we sought to determine the smallest angular shift in the vertical location of a sound that infants could reliably detect (i.e., minimum audible angle). A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used in which a sequence of white noise bursts was presented initially at 0 degree, and then shifted vertically (i.e., above or below 0 degree) and continued to be presented until the infant made a directional response; correct responses were visually reinforced. The smallest angular shift in vertical location that was reliably detected systematically decreased with increasing age between 6 months (15 degrees) and 18 months (4 degrees), suggesting a finer partitioning of auditory space along the vertical axis over this age range. By 18 months infants' performance matched that of a group of adults tested under the same circumstances.},

abstract = {Horizontal sound localization relies on the extraction of binaural acoustic cues by integration of the signals from the two ears at the level of the brainstem. The present experiment was aimed at detecting the sites of binaural integration in the human brainstem using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a binaural difference paradigm, in which the responses to binaural sounds were compared with the sum of the responses to the corresponding monaural sounds. The experiment also included a moving sound condition, which was contrasted against a spectrally and energetically matched stationary sound condition to assess which of the structures that are involved in general binaural processing are specifically specialized in motion processing. The binaural difference contrast revealed a substantial binaural response suppression in the inferior colliculus in the midbrain, the medial geniculate body in the thalamus and the primary auditory cortex. The effect appears to reflect an actual reduction of the underlying activity, probably brought about by binaural inhibition or refractoriness at the level of the superior olivary complex. Whereas all structures up to and including the primary auditory cortex were activated as strongly by the stationary as by the moving sounds, non-primary auditory fields in the planum temporale responded selectively to the moving sounds. These results suggest a hierarchical organization of auditory spatial processing in which the general analysis of binaural information begins as early as the brainstem, while the representation of dynamic binaural cues relies on non-primary auditory fields in the planum temporale.},

abstract = {The development of the acoustics of the auditory periphery of the ferret was examined by measuring the spectral transfer functions (STFs) and the directional characteristics of the outer ears of animals ranging in age from postnatal day 32 (P32) to P54. Using an impulse response technique the STFs were obtained from up to 250 locations throughout free space. The directional responses were calculated for frequencies between 1 kHz and 30 kHz. The low frequency roll-off of the STF decreased with increasing age from around 15 kHz at P32 to an adult value of around 8 kHz by P51. The directional responses of the outer ear of the immature ferrets differed significantly from adult animals in a fashion that was consistent with the smaller size of the auditory periphery. However, by P51 the responses were generally within the normal adult range. The implications of the relatively rapid development of the acoustics of the auditory periphery are discussed in terms of the development of mechanisms subserving sound localization.},

Using a preferential looking technique with looming and receding visual and auditory stimuli, we examined the multisensory integration of looming stimuli by rhesus monkeys. We found a strong attentional preference for coincident visual and auditory looming but no analogous preference for coincident stimulus recession. Consistent with previous findings, the effect occurred only with tonal stimuli and not with broadband noise. The results suggest an evolved capacity to integrate multisensory looming objects.},

abstract = {Some past studies suggest that when sound elements are heard as one object, the spatial cues in the component elements are integrated to determine perceived location, and that this integration is reduced when the elements are perceived in separate objects. The current study explored how object localization depends on the spatial, spectral, and temporal configurations of sound elements in an auditory scene. Localization results are interpreted in light of results from a series of previous experiments studying perceptual grouping of the same stimuli, e.g., Shinn-Cunningham et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 12223-12227 (2007)]. The current results suggest that the integration (pulling) of spatial information across spectrally interleaved elements is obligatory when these elements are simultaneous, even though past results show that these simultaneous sound elements are not grouped strongly into a single perceptual object. In contrast, perceptually distinct objects repel (push) each other spatially with a strength that decreases as the temporal separation between competing objects increases. These results show that the perceived location of an attended object is not easily predicted by knowledge of how sound elements contribute to the perceived spectro-temporal content of that object.},

The test was also administered to a group of adults. BMLDs for the non-OM children were not significantly different from those of adults. However the mean BMLD of the OM children was significantly lower than that of non-OM children. Some children in the OM group had small (15-25 dB HL) sensitivity deficits in one or both ears. However, no correlation was found between BMLD and hearing level in cases of either symmetric or asymmetric loss. Exclusion of OM children with residual middle ear abnormalities did not abolish the significant difference between the OM and non-OM groups. We suggest that the small BMLDs in the OM group may be associated with these children having difficulties detecting and attending to signals in noisy environments.},

abstract = {Latency of the contralateral suppression of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) has been investigated using the ILO88 system for ipsilateral stimulation and recording, and a laboratory computer interface producing contralateral noise bursts. Reduction of rms amplitude in the last 10.24 ms of the response was found to produce the most consistent indication of suppression. Onset latencies varied from less than 40 ms to 140 ms, offset latency from 20 ms to more than 80 ms. Acoustic reflex latencies have not been reported with such short latencies and this makes it unlikely that this reflex can be responsible for the contralateral suppression of TEOAE. This study used contralateral stimuli at 70 dB HL. Lower level stimuli may result in increased amplitude and it is also possible that the effect of contralateral stimulation may be frequency specific. The long offset latency necessitates long intervals between stimuli with an inherent risk of variation in stimulus and recording conditions. This makes an elaborate study of the latency difficult to perform in humans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Oscillations are an important aspect of brain activity, but they often have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to source-to-electrode mixing with competing brain activity and noise. Filtering can improve the SNR of narrowband signals, but it introduces ringing effects that may masquerade as genuine oscillations, leading to uncertainty as to the true oscillatory nature of the phenomena. Likewise, time-frequency analysis kernels have a temporal extent that blurs the time course of narrowband activity, introducing uncertainty as to timing and causal relations between events and/or frequency bands.

APPROACH:Here, we propose a methodology that reveals narrowband activity within multichannel data such as electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, electrocorticography or local field potential. The method exploits the between-channel correlation structure of the data to suppress competing sources by joint diagonalization of the covariance matrices of narrowband filtered and unfiltered data.

MAIN RESULTS:Applied to synthetic and real data, the method effectively extracts narrowband components at unfavorable SNR.

SIGNIFICANCE:Oscillatory components of brain activity, including weak sources that are hard or impossible to observe using standard methods, can be detected and their time course plotted accurately. The method avoids the temporal artifacts of standard filtering and time-frequency analysis methods with which it remains complementary.},

abstract = {Auditory selective attention enables task-relevant auditory events to be enhanced and irrelevant ones suppressed. In the present study we used a frequency tagging paradigm to investigate the effects of attention on auditory steady state responses (ASSR). The ASSR was elicited by simultaneously presenting two different streams of white noise, amplitude modulated at either 16 and 23.5 Hz or 32.5 and 40 Hz. The two different frequencies were presented to each ear and participants were instructed to selectively attend to one ear or the other (confirmed by behavioral evidence). The results revealed that modulation of ASSR by selective attention depended on the modulation frequencies used and whether the activation was contralateral or ipsilateral. Attention enhanced the ASSR for contralateral activation from either ear for 16 Hz and suppressed the ASSR for ipsilateral activation for 16 Hz and 23.5 Hz. For modulation frequencies of 32.5 or 40 Hz attention did not affect the ASSR. We propose that the pattern of enhancement and inhibition may be due to binaural suppressive effects on ipsilateral stimulation and the dominance of contralateral hemisphere during dichotic listening. In addition to the influence of cortical processing asymmetries, these results may also reflect a bias towards inhibitory ipsilateral and excitatory contralateral activation present at the level of inferior colliculus. That the effect of attention was clearest for the lower modulation frequencies suggests that such effects are likely mediated by cortical brain structures or by those in close proximity to cortex.},

abstract = {The auditory sensory end organ is under the control of the central nervous system via efferent projections. Contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions (acoustic signatures of the cochlear biomechanical activity) provides a non-invasive approach to assess olivocochlear efferent activity in humans. Using this approach, the present study compared professional musicians with musically-inexperienced subjects. The results revealed stronger bilateral cochlear suppression, suggesting larger efferent influences in both ears, in musicians. Furthermore, in indicating no difference in left/right asymmetry of efferent-mediated suppression between the two groups, the present findings suggest that the observed differences in olivocochlear activity reflect bilaterally-enhanced activity of the cortical auditory structures in musicians rather than differences in cerebral hemispheric asymmetry between the two groups.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are sounds of cochlear origin, which can be recorded by a microphone fitted into the ear canal. They are caused by the motion of the cochlea's sensory hair cells as they energetically respond to auditory stimulation. OAEs provide a simple, efficient and non-invasive objective indicator of healthy cochlear function and OAE screening is widely used in universal new-born hearing screening programmes. As part of the audiological diagnostic test battery, OAEs can contribute to differential audiological diagnosis, they can be used to monitor the effects of treatment and they can be helpful in the selection of hearing aids and of surgical options. As a research tool, OAEs provide a non-invasive window on intracochlear processes and this has led to new insights into the mechanisms and function of the cochlea and also to a new understanding of the nature of sensory hearing impairment. This chapter provides a broad introduction to OAEs and their applications together with a detailed description of the relationship between OAEs and cochlear mechanisms.},

abstract = {Steady-state responses can be recorded from the human scalp in response to tones that are sinusoidally modulated in amplitude at rates between 60 and 120 Hz. For 60 dB SPL 1000-Hz tones the maximum baseline-to-peak amplitude of about 0.06 microV occurs for modulation rates between 80 and 95 Hz. The phase of the response does not change with modulation depths greater than 25% and the amplitude saturates at modulation depths greater than 50%. The presence or absence of a response can be accurately determined by frequency-domain statistics and the response becomes clearly recognizable at intensities that are 16 +/- 8 dB above behavioral thresholds. With increasing intensity the response increases in amplitude at 1.9 nV/dB until an intensity of 70 dB SPL. As the intensity increases above 70 dB SPL the response increases in amplitude more rapidly at 7.8 nV/dB (at 1000 Hz) and contains significant energy at harmonics of the modulation frequency. This second stage of the intensity function is more prominent for stimuli with lower carrier frequencies (500 more than 1000 more than 2000 Hz) and is attenuated by high-pass masking. These steady-state responses should be helpful in evaluating human auditory physiology and in objective audiometry.},

Non-invasive neuroimaging studies in humans have similarly shown that sounds modulate activity in visual areas even in the absence of visual stimuli or visual task demands. However, the spatial and temporal limitations of these non-invasive methods prevent the determination of how rapidly sounds activate early visual cortex and what information about the sounds is relayed there. Using spatially and temporally precise measures of local synaptic activity acquired from depth electrodes in humans, we demonstrate that peripherally presented sounds evoke activity in the anterior portion of the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, calcarine sulcus within 28 ms of sound onset. These results suggest that auditory stimuli rapidly evoke spatially specific activity in visual cortex even in the absence of concurrent visual stimulation or visual task demands. This rapid auditory-evoked activation of primary visual cortex is likely to be mediated by subcortical pathways or direct cortical projections from auditory to visual areas.},

abstract = {Measurements of double-click-evoked otoacoustics emissions (2CEOAEs) and double-chirp distortion products (2ChDPs) are reported for normal-hearing adults based upon theory presented in an earlier report [Keefe, J. Acoust, Soc. Am. 103, 3489-3498 (1998)]. The nonlinear acoustic response of a probe assembly used in ear-canal measurements in tested in a calibration cavity to compare the double-evoked (2E) technique with existing OAE techniques. The 2E technique reduces the peak distortion by approximately 30 dB relative to existing click-evoked techniques. The 2E subtraction of click responses is partially analogous to current techniques in that the linear response is eliminated, but differs in that high-frequency measurements are improved by eliminating time gating of the cochlear response, and low-frequency measurements are improved by reducing probe distortion, especially when two acoustic sources are used. Because time gating is eliminated, it is straightforward to measure the onset of a click-evoked OAE. The nonlinear coherence function is used to measure the nonlinear distortion signal-to-noise ratio (DNR) for the 2ChDPs and 2CEOAEs. The DNR is typically 20-30 dB. An intermittent noise rejection technique is implemented in real time that compares a currently acquired ear-canal response with a stored response. Dissimilar responses indicate the presence of intermittent noise, and the noise-contaminated responses are thereby discarded before ensemble averaging.},

Binaural masking level differences for tonal stimuli and auditory brain stem responses for click stimuli are also reported. Results indicate lower overall scores for the experimental group on the diotic as well as dichotic conditions for the binaural fusion tasks, although both groups scored relatively higher in the diotic condition. Masking level differences and auditory brain stem responses were not significantly different for the two groups. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of binaural fusion measures in the assessment of auditory processing abilities in children, although certain cautions regarding their application and interpretation must be exercised.},

abstract = {Attention and arousal are multi-dimensional psychological processes, which interact closely with one another. The neural substrates of attention, as well as the interaction between arousal and attention, are discussed in this review. After a brief discussion of psychological and neuropsychological theories of attention, event-related potential correlates of attention are discussed. Essentially, attention acts to modulate stimulus-induced electrical potentials (N100/P100, P300, N400), rather than generating any unique potentials of its own. Functional neuroimaging studies of attentional orienting, selective attention, divided attention and sustained attention (and its inter-dependence on underlying levels of arousal) are then reviewed. A distinction is drawn between the brain areas which are crucially involved in the top-down modulation of attention (the 'sources' of attention) and those sensory-association areas whose activity is modulated by attention (the 'sites' of attentional expression). Frontal and parietal (usually right-lateralised) cortices and thalamus are most often associated with the source of attentional modulation. Also, the use of functional neuroimaging to test explicit hypotheses about psychological theories of attention is emphasised. These experimental paradigms form the basis for a 'new generation' of functional imaging studies which exploit the dynamic aspect of imaging and demonstrate how it can be used as more than just a 'brain mapping' device. Finally, a review of psychopharmacological studies in healthy human volunteers outlines the contributions of the noradrenergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems to the neurochemical modulation of human attention and arousal. While, noradrenergic and cholinergic systems are involved in 'low-level' aspects of attention (e.g. attentional orienting), the dopaminergic system is associated with more 'executive' aspects of attention such as attentional set-shifting or working memory.},

abstract = {Loud sounds damage the cochlea, the auditory receptor organ, reducing hearing sensitivity. Previous studies demonstrate that the centrifugal olivocochlear pathways can moderately reduce these temporary threshold shifts (TTSs), protecting the cochlea. This effect involves only the olivocochlear pathway component known as the crossed medial olivocochlear system pathway, originating from the contralateral brainstem and terminating on outer hair cells in the cochlea. Here I demonstrate that even moderate noise backgrounds can significantly exacerbate the cochlear TTSs induced by loud tones, but this is prevented because in such conditions there is additional activation of uncrossed olivocochlear pathways, enhancing protection of cochlear hearing sensitivity. Activation of the uncrossed pathways differs from that of the crossed pathway in that it is achieved only in noise backgrounds but can then be obtained under monaural conditions of loud tone and background noise. In contrast, activation of the crossed pathway is achieved only by binaural loud tones and is not further enhanced by background noise. Thus, conjoint activation of both crossed and uncrossed efferent pathways can occur in noise backgrounds to powerfully protect the cochlea under conditions similar to those encountered naturally by humans.},

abstract = {The dynamic properties of single olivocochlear efferent neurones in the guinea pig cochlea were examined using sinusoidally amplitude modulated (AM) pure tones. The neural discharge, when displayed as a cyclic histogram, clearly followed the rapid fluctuations in the continuous input sound. Modulation transfer functions (MTFs) were constructed and in most cases showed a peak in the modulation response (MR) at a modulation frequency (MF) of 100 Hz. At this frequency a gain of as much as 12 dB was evident relative to the 30% modulated input signal. In 24% of neurones however, a large MR was present even at low MFs. This plurality of MTFs may be the result of recorded neurones emanating from a variety of cell bodies of origin. Efferent group delays (mean of 8.2 +/- 1.0 ms) were shorter and more tightly distributed than the minimum onset latency measurements (mean of 24.2 +/- 12.5) made on the same neurones. It seems evident that a post-synaptic potential build is required from the onset of a stimulus to the first spike discharge. This may occur within a single afferent-interneurone(s)-efferent reflex arc. Among a variety of alternative explanations, the observation is consistent with the notion that the olivocochlear neurones receive facilitatory input from higher centres, which is suppressed under barbiturate anaesthesia. Continuous AM signals may allow post-synaptic build up and eliminate the dependence on this higher input and hence yield a short group delay.},

Human studies have been inconsistent in demonstrating a clear connection between this corticofugal system and behavioral speech-in-noise (SIN) listening skills. To elucidate the role of brainstem efferent activity in SIN perception, we measured ear-specific contralateral suppression of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), a proxy measure of MOC activation linked to auditory learning in noisy environments. We show that suppression of cochlear emissions is stronger with a more basal cochlear bias in the right ear compared with the left ear. Moreover, a strong negative correlation was observed between behavioral SIN performance and right-ear OAE suppression magnitudes, such that lower speech reception thresholds in noise were predicted by larger amounts of MOC-related activity. This brain-behavioral relation was not observed for left ear SIN perception. The rightward bias in contralateral MOC suppression of OAEs, coupled with the stronger association between physiological and perceptual measures, is consistent with left-hemisphere cerebral dominance for speech-language processing. We posit that corticofugal feedback from the left cerebral cortex through descending MOC projections sensitizes the right cochlea to signal-in-noise detection, facilitating figure-ground contrast and improving degraded speech analysis. Our findings demonstrate that SIN listening is at least partly driven by subcortical brain mechanisms; primitive stages of cochlear processing and brainstem MOC modulation of (right) inner ear mechanics play a critical role in dictating SIN understanding.},

abstract = {The scalp-recorded amplitude-modulation following response (AMFR) is gaining recognition as an objective audiometric tool, but little is known about the neural sources that underlie this potential. We hypothesized, based on our human studies and single-unit recordings in animals, that the scalp-recorded AMFR reflects the interaction of multiple sources. We tested this hypothesis using an animal model, the unanesthetized rabbit. We compared AMFRs recorded from the surface of the brain at different locations and before and after the administration of agents likely to enhance or suppress neural generators. We also recorded AMFRs locally at several stations along the auditory neuraxis. We conclude that the surface-recorded AMFR is indeed a composite response from multiple brain generators. Although the response at any modulation frequency can reflect the activity of more than one generator, the AMFRs to low and high modulation frequencies appear to reflect a strong contribution from cortical and subcortical sources, respectively.},

By labeling the somata of olivocochlear neurons after injection of HRP into the cochlea and simultaneously labeling terminal endings of PVCN efferent neurons after injection of PHA-L into PVCN, we observed neuronal connections between these two elements within all regions of the superior olivary complex known to contain olivocochlear neurons. These regions include the superior paraolivary nucleus, medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, lateral superior olive, and periolivary regions. All possible projection patterns regarding side of input and output of both large (four combinations) and small (two combinations) olivocochlear neurons were observed. However, the most frequently observed pattern was the PVCN projection to a contralaterally located and contralaterally projecting, large olivocochlear neuron. Thus the most prevalent pattern demonstrated a feedback pathway that crossed the brainstem twice. Additional patterns demonstrated pathways that fed back to the same cochlea as well as pathways that fed forward to the opposite cochlea.},

abstract = {Degradations in external, acoustic stimulation have long been suspected to increase the load on working memory (WM). One neural signature of WM load is enhanced power of alpha oscillations (6-12 Hz). However, it is unknown to what extent common internal, auditory degradation, that is, hearing impairment, affects the neural mechanisms of WM when audibility has been ensured via amplification. Using an adapted auditory Sternberg paradigm, we varied the orthogonal factors memory load and background noise level, while the electroencephalogram was recorded. In each trial, participants were presented with 2, 4, or 6 spoken digits embedded in one of three different levels of background noise. After a stimulus-free delay interval, participants indicated whether a probe digit had appeared in the sequence of digits. Participants were healthy older adults (62-86 years), with normal to moderately impaired hearing. Importantly, the background noise levels were individually adjusted and participants were wearing hearing aids to equalize audibility across participants. Irrespective of hearing loss (HL), behavioral performance improved with lower memory load and also with lower levels of background noise. Interestingly, the alpha power in the stimulus-free delay interval was dependent on the interplay between task demands (memory load and noise level) and HL; while alpha power increased with HL during low and intermediate levels of memory load and background noise, it dropped for participants with the relatively most severe HL under the highest memory load and background noise level. These findings suggest that adaptive neural mechanisms for coping with adverse listening conditions break down for higher degrees of HL, even when adequate hearing aid amplification is in place.},

abstract = {An efficient method for measuring stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) was developed incorporating (1) stimulus with swept frequency or level and (2) the digital heterodyne analysis. SFOAEs were measured for 550-1450 Hz and stimulus levels of 32-62 dB sound pressure level in eight normal human adults. The mean level, number of peaks, frequency spacing between peaks, phase change, and energy-weighted group delays of SFOAEs were determined. Salient features of the human SFOAEs were stimulated with an active cochlear model containing spatially low-pass filtered irregularity in the impedance. An objective fitting procedure yielded an optimal set of model parameters where, with decreasing stimulus level, the amount of cochlear amplification and the base amplitude of the irregularity increased while the spatial low-pass cutoff and the slope of the spatial low-pass filter decreased. The characteristics of the human cochlea were inferred with the model. In the model, an SFOAE consisted of a long-delay component originating from irregularity in a traveling-wave peak region and a short-delay component originating from irregularity in regions remote from the peak. The results of this study should be useful both for understanding cochlear function and for developing a clinical method of assessing cochlear status.},

abstract = {The medial-olivocochlear (MOC) acoustic reflex is thought to provide frequency-specific feedback that adjusts the gain of cochlear amplification, but little is known about how frequency specific the reflex actually is. We measured human MOC tuning through changes in stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) from 40-dB-SPL tones at probe frequencies (f(p)s) near 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0 kHz. MOC activity was elicited by 60-dB-SPL ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral tones or half-octave noise bands, with elicitor frequency (f(e)) varied in half-octave steps. Tone and noise elicitors produced similar results. At all probe frequencies, SFOAE changes were produced by a wide range of elicitor frequencies with elicitor frequencies near 0.7-2.0 kHz being particularly effective. MOC-induced changes in SFOAE magnitude and SFOAE phase were surprisingly different functions of f(e): magnitude inhibition largest for f(e) close to f(p), phase change largest for f(e) remote from f(p). The metric $\Delta$SFOAE, which combines both magnitude and phase changes, provided the best match to reported (cat) MOC neural inhibition. Ipsilateral and contralateral MOC reflexes often showed dramatic differences in plots of MOC effect vs. elicitor frequency, indicating that the contralateral reflex does not give an accurate picture of ipsilateral-reflex properties. These differences in MOC effects appear to imply that ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes have different actions in the cochlea. The implication of these results for MOC function, cochlear mechanics, and the production of SFOAEs are discussed.},

abstract = {Forward masking has often been thought of in terms of neural adaptation, with nonlinearities in the growth and decay of forward masking being accounted for by the nonlinearities inherent in adaptation. In contrast, this study presents further evidence for the hypothesis that forward masking can be described as a linear process, once peripheral, mechanical nonlinearities are taken into account. The first experiment compares the growth of masking for on- and off-frequency maskers. Signal thresholds were measured as a function of masker level for three masker-signal intervals of 0, 10, and 30 ms. The brief 4-kHz sinusoidal signal was masked by a 200-ms sinusoidal forward masker which had a frequency of either 2.4 kHz (off-frequency) or 4 kHz (on-frequency). As in previous studies, for the on-frequency condition, the slope of the function relating signal threshold to masker level became shallower as the delay between the masker and signal was increased. In contrast, the slopes for the off-frequency condition were independent of masker-signal delay and had a value of around unity, indicating linear growth of masking for all masker-signal delays. In the second experiment, a broadband Gaussian noise forward masker was used to mask a brief 6-kHz sinusoidal signal. The spectrum level of the masker was either 0 or 40 dB (re: 20 microPa). The gap between the masker and signal was either 0 or 20 ms. Signal thresholds were measured for masker durations from 5 to 200 ms. The effect of masker duration was found to depend more on signal level than on gap duration or masker level. Overall, the results support the idea that forward masking can be modeled as a linear process, preceded by a static nonlinearity resembling that found on the basilar membrane.},

abstract = {At low stimulus levels, basilar-membrane (BM) mechanical transfer functions in sensitive cochleae manifest a quasiperiodic rippling pattern in both amplitude and phase. Analysis of the responses of active cochlear models suggests that the rippling is a mechanical interference pattern created by multiple internal reflection within the cochlea. In models, the interference arises when reverse-traveling waves responsible for stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) reflect off the stapes on their way to the ear canal, launching a secondary forward-traveling wave that combines with the primary wave produced by the stimulus. Frequency-dependent phase differences between the two waves then create the rippling pattern measurable on the BM. Measurements of BM ripples and SFOAEs in individual chinchilla ears demonstrate that the ripples are strongly correlated with the acoustic interference pattern measured in ear-canal pressure, consistent with a common origin involving the generation of SFOAEs. In BM responses to clicks, the ripples appear as temporal fine structure in the response envelope (multiple lobes, waxing and waning). Analysis of the ripple spacing and response phase gradients provides a test for the role of fast- and slow-wave modes of reverse energy propagation within the cochlea. The data indicate that SFOAE delays are consistent with reverse slow-wave propagation but much too long to be explained by fast waves.},

abstract = {From an ecological point of view, approaching objects are potentially more harmful than receding objects. A predator, a dominant conspecific, or a mere branch coming up at high speed can all be dangerous if one does not detect them and produce the appropriate escape behavior fast enough. And indeed, looming stimuli trigger stereotyped defensive responses in both monkeys and human infants. However, while the heteromodal somatosensory consequences of visual looming stimuli can be fully predicted by their spatiotemporal dynamics, few studies if any have explored whether visual stimuli looming toward the face predictively enhance heteromodal tactile sensitivity around the expected time of impact and at its expected location on the body. In the present study, we report that, in addition to triggering a defensive motor repertoire, looming stimuli toward the face provide the nervous system with predictive cues that enhance tactile sensitivity on the face. Specifically, we describe an enhancement of tactile processes at the expected time and location of impact of the stimulus on the face. We additionally show that a looming stimulus that brushes past the face also enhances tactile sensitivity on the nearby cheek, suggesting that the space close to the face is incorporated into the subjects' body schema. We propose that this cross-modal predictive facilitation involves multisensory convergence areas subserving the representation of a peripersonal space and a safety boundary of self.},

abstract = {Steady-state responses evoked by simultaneously presented amplitude-modulated tones were measured by examining the spectral components in the recording that corresponded to the different modulation frequencies. When using modulation frequencies between 70 and 110 Hz and an intensity of 60 dB SPL, there were significant interactions between two stimuli when the carrier frequencies were closer than one half of an octave apart, with attenuation of the response to the lower carrier frequency. However, there were no significant decreases in response amplitude with four simultaneous stimuli provided the carrier frequencies differed by one octave or more. Higher intensities (70 dB SPL) resulted in greater interactions between the stimuli than when low intensities (35 dB SPL) were used. Modulation frequencies could be as closely spaced as 1.3 Hz without affecting the responses. Using broad-band noise as a carrier instead of a pure tone resulted in a significantly larger response when the stimuli were presented at the same sound pressure level. At modulation frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz, there were greater interactions between stimuli than at faster modulation frequencies. These results support the following recommendations for using multiple stimuli in evoked potential audiometry: (1) The multiple stimulus technique works well for steady state responses at frequencies between 70 and 110 Hz. (2) Up to four stimuli can be simultaneously presented to an ear without significant loss in amplitude of the response, provided the carrier frequencies are separated by an octave and the intensities are 60 dB SPL or less. (3) Bandpass noise might serve as a better carrier signal than pure tones.},

All neurones subsequently identified as efferent neurones had clear features of their response properties which distinguished them from primary auditory afferents. They had long latency, low maximum discharge rate and low levels of spontaneous activity under Nembutal/Innovar anaesthesia. The pattern of discharge was extremely regular, revealed by symmetrical interspike interval histograms. 49.4% responded best to ipsilateral, 43.3% to contralateral sound and a third group of 7.3% responded equally well to either ipsilateral or contralateral sound. In cochleae in good physiological condition, these efferents were as sensitive and as sharply tuned as primary afferents with the same characteristic frequencies (CFs). All efferents fully traced in histological processing terminated on the outer hair cells. Several efferents showed extensive branching beneath the inner hair cells which might represent en passant synapses with other neuronal elements. There was clear evidence of tonotopic organization of the efferent projection. The site of termination on the outer hair cells in most instances was very close to the region of the cochlea predicted from the fibres' CF and the known place-frequency map for primary afferent neurones in the guinea pig.},

These data are consistent with those reported previously in animals and demonstrate that, during medial efferent stimulation in humans, frequency resolution is improved at low frequencies but impaired at high frequencies.

OBJECTIVE:To evaluate, in humans, the effect of activation of the contralateral efferent acoustic reflex (EAR) on the psychoacoustical tuning curves (PTCs) recorded for 1- and 4-kHz probe tones. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ten young (20-30 years) volunteers served as subjects. They had normal hearing (thresholds <20 dB HL in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz) and a functioning EAR (contralateral suppression of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions > or = 0.8 dB). Frequency resolution was evaluated using PTCs. PTCs were recorded at 1 and 4 kHz using a simultaneous masking method. Q10 and Q20 were calculated as the ratio between the test frequency and the bandwidth of the PTC at 10 and 20 dB above the tip of the curve, respectively. The EAR was activated with a 40-dB SL contralateral narrow-band noise centered on the characteristic frequency of the PTC (1 or 4 kHz). Q10 and Q20 were measured in the presence and absence of the contralateral noise.

RESULTS:Activation of the EAR led to a significant increase (p < 0.001) in Q10 at 1 kHz and a significant decrease (p <0.001) at 4 kHz. Changes in the value of Q20 were not significant.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Auditory processing disorder (APD) is characterised by listening difficulties despite a normal audiogram. APD is becoming ever more widely diagnosed in children, though there is a controversy over definition, diagnosis and aetiology. This study sought to describe presenting features and investigate aetiological factors for children diagnosed with APD compared to those for whom APD was excluded.

METHODS:Medical notes for children referred to a specialist hospital-based APD clinic were reviewed in relation to presenting features and potential aetiological factors.

RESULTS:32 children diagnosed with APD and 57 non-APD children were compared. They reported similar symptoms and similarly had high rates of co-morbid learning problems. No aetiological factor (including history of otitis media, adverse obstetric history or familial history of listening problems) predicted APD group membership.

CONCLUSIONS:Children identified with APD on the basis of commonly used APD tests cannot be distinguished on the basis of presenting features or the aetiological factors examined here. One explanation is that learning problems exist independently of auditory processing difficulties and the aetiological factors do not have a strong causal role in APD. However, no gold standard for APD testing exists and an alternative explanation is that the commonly used APD tests used as selection criteria in this study may be unreliable.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study is to provide developmental standards on a variety of temporal, spectral, and binaural psychoacoustic (auditory processing [AP]) tests in typically developing children, including immediate and delayed retest reliability, and comparisons between single listener performance on different tests. This study also informs choices on the selection of tests for clinical evaluation of hearing and listening (e.g., for auditory processing disorder).

DESIGN:This is a laboratory-based study of AP threshold and variability of 75 children, aged 6 to 11 yrs, and 21 young adults with normal audiometry recruited from local schools and colleges. Data were gathered in clinic-like conditions, without training and across two sessions. Eleven individual (e.g., simultaneous masking and backward masking [BM], amplitude modulation [AM], and frequency modulation [FM] detection) and three derived (temporal integration, frequency resolution, masking level difference) measure tests were embedded within a suite of computer games, each employing a three-interval, three-alternative (odd-one-out) forced choice response paradigm and a staircase adaptive method.

RESULTS:AP measures generally showed lower thresholds and reduced variance with increasing age. At 6 to 7 yrs, performance was markedly poorer than in the older groups; 35% of the children could not do the test of frequency discrimination (FD). However, on all the tasks, some children in the same group performed at near-adult levels. The distribution of performance between individuals varied widely across tasks, with clustered performance on tests of tone detection (with or without a simultaneous masker) and AM detection, and scattered performance on BM, FM detection, and FD. Threshold maturity was achieved at different rates across tests and by 10 to 11 yrs of age on all tests except FD. Masking level difference (MLD) performance did not change with age. Retest reliability was mostly high within test sessions but, again, was poorer for some of the younger children. Between test sessions separated by one to several weeks, reliability varied from poor (for FM detection) to high (for long tone detection in quiet, BM, and FD). Correlations between thresholds on different tests were generally low.

CONCLUSIONS:Data suggest that the perception of different auditory stimuli occurs and develops using rather independent mechanisms, even for tasks that are closely related in procedure. While individual children can perform reliably on several distinct tasks, differences between individuals on the same tasks can be large. Because some of the youngest children perform reliably across time, at or near adult levels, immaturity between 6 and 11 yrs of age, as reflected in group statistics, reflects poor performance of some individual children rather than obligate, age-related deficits in AP. While several of the tests used were found to have potential clinical applicability, because of their reliability and ability to distinguish between individuals, it is currently unclear how performance on such tests relates to everyday listening skills.},

abstract = {Speech perception is supported by both acoustic signal decomposition and semantic context. This study, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, investigated the neural basis of this interaction with two speech manipulations, one acoustic (spectral degradation) and the other cognitive (semantic predictability). High compared with low predictability resulted in the greatest improvement in comprehension at an intermediate level of degradation, and this was associated with increased activity in the left angular gyrus, the medial and left lateral prefrontal cortices, and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Functional connectivity between these regions was also increased, particularly with respect to the left angular gyrus. In contrast, activity in both superior temporal sulci and the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with the amount of spectral detail in the speech signal, regardless of predictability. These results demonstrate that increasing functional connectivity between high-order cortical areas, remote from the auditory cortex, facilitates speech comprehension when the clarity of speech is reduced.},

abstract = {Free-field release from masking was studied as a function of the spatial separation of a signal and masker in a two-interval, forced-choice (2IFC) adaptive paradigm. The signal was a 250-ms train of clicks (100/s) generated by filtering 50-microseconds pulses with a TDH-49 speaker (0.9 to 9.0 kHz). The masker was continuous broadband (0.7 to 11 kHz) white noise presented at a level of 44 dBA measured at the position of the subject's head. In experiment I, masked and absolute thresholds were measured for 36 signal source locations (10 degree increments) along the horizontal plane as a function of seven masking source locations (30 degree increments). In experiment II, both absolute and masked thresholds were measured for seven signal locations along three vertical planes located at azimuthal rotations of 0 degrees (median vertical plane), 45 degrees, and 90 degrees. In experiment III, monaural absolute and masked thresholds were measured for various signal-masker configurations. Masking-level differences (MLDs) were computed relative to the condition where the signal and mask were in front of the subjects after using absolute thresholds to account for differences in the signal's sound-pressure level (SPL) due to direction. Maximum MLDs were 15 dB along the horizontal plane, 8 dB along the vertical, and 9 dB under monaural conditions.},

abstract = {Detailed, quantitative studies were made of the interaural phase sensitivity of 197 neurons with low best frequency in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the barbiturate-anesthetized cat. We analyzed the responses of single cells to interaural delays in which tone bursts were delivered to the two ears via sealed earphones and the onset of the tone to one ear with respect to the other was varied. For most (80%) cells the discharge rate is a cyclic function of interaural delay at a period corresponding to that of the stimulating frequency. The cyclic nature of the interaural delay curve indicates that these cells are sensitive to the interaural phase difference. These cells are distributed throughout the low-frequency zone of the IC, but they are less numerous in the medial and caudal zones. Cells with a wide variety of response patterns will exhibit interaural phase sensitivities at stimulating frequencies up to 3,100 Hz, although above 2,500 Hz the number of such cells decrease markedly. Using dichotic stimuli we could study the cell's sensitivity to the onset delay and interaural phase independently. The large majority of IC cells respond only to changes in interaural phase, with no sensitivity to the onset delay. However, a small number (7%) of cells exhibit a sensitivity to the onset delay as well as to the interaural phase disparity, and most of these cells show an onset response. The effects of changing the stimulus intensity equally to both ears or of changing the interaural intensity difference on the mean interaural phase were studied. While some neurons are not affected by level changes, others exhibit systematic phase shifts for both average and interaural intensity variations, and there is a continuous distribution of sensitivities between these extremes. A few cells also showed systematic changes in the shape of the interaural delay curves as a function of interaural intensity difference, especially at very long delays. These shifts can be interpreted as a form of time-intensity trading. A few cells demonstrated orderly changes in the interaural delay curve as the repetition rate of the stimulus was varied. Some of these changes are consonant with an inhibitory effect that occurs at stimulus offset. The responses of the neurons show a strong bias for stimuli that would originate from he contralateral sound field; 77% of the responses display mean interaural phase angles that are less than 0.5 of a cycle, which are delays to the ipsilateral tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Infants 6, 12, and 18 months of age were tested using a Go/No-Go conditioned head-turn procedure in which infants received an equal number of no-change (control) trials and sound-shift (experimental) trials. A correct response (i.e., a head turn toward the loud-speakers) on an experimental trial resulted in visual reinforcement. Localization acuity for sounds within hemifields was fairly poor and improved systematically with increasing age. MAA estimates at each age were significantly higher, indicating poorer localization acuity, in comparison to those obtained previously in research examining infants' resolution of auditory space near midline. These findings are consistent with adult data and demonstrate a finer partitioning of auditory space near midline than within hemifields. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the development of auditory processing mechanisms in sound localization are discussed.},

abstract = {The growth of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) suppression follows a systematic, frequency-dependent pattern. The pattern is consistent with direct measures of basilar-membrane response growth, psychoacoustic measures of masking growth, and measures of neural rate growth. This pattern has its basis in the recognized nonlinear properties of basilar-membrane motion and, as such, the DPOAE suppression growth paradigm can be applied to human neonates to study the maturation of cochlear nonlinearity. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the maturation of human cochlear nonlinearity and define the time course for this maturational process. Normal-hearing adults, children, term-born neonates, and premature neonates, plus a small number of children with sensorineural hearing loss, were included in this experiment. DPOAE suppression growth was measured at two f2 frequencies (1500 and 6000 Hz) and three primary tone levels (55{\textendash}45, 65{\textendash}55, and 75{\textendash}65 dB SPL). Slope of DPOAE suppression growth, as well as an asymmetry ratio (to compare slope for suppressor tones below and above f2 frequency), were generated. Suppression threshold was also measured in all subjects. Findings indicate that both term-born neonates and premature neonates who have attained term-like age, show non-adult-like DPOAE suppression growth for low-frequency suppressor tones. These age effects are most evident at f2=6000  Hz . In neonates, suppression growth is shallower and suppression thresholds are elevated for suppressor tones lower in frequency than f2. Additionally, the asymmetry ratio is smaller in neonates, indicating that the typical frequency-dependent pattern of suppression growth is not present. These findings suggest that an immaturity of cochlear nonlinearity persists into the first months of postnatal life. DPOAE suppression growth examined for a small group of hearing-impaired children also showed abnormalities.},

abstract = {Lip reading is known to activate the planum temporale (PT), a brain region which may integrate visual and auditory information. To find out whether other types of learned audio-visual integration occur in the PT, we investigated "key-touch reading" using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As well-trained pianists are able to identify pieces of music by watching the key-touching movements of the hands, we hypothesised that the visual information of observed sequential finger movements is transformed into the auditory modality during "key-touch reading" as is the case during lip reading. We therefore predicted activation of the PT during key-touch reading. Twenty-six healthy right-handed volunteers were recruited for fMRI. Of these, 7 subjects had never experienced piano training (na{\"\i}ve group), 10 had a little experience of piano playing (less trained group), and the remaining 9 had been trained for more than 8 years (well trained group). During task periods, subjects were required to view the bimanual hand movements of a piano player making key presses. During control periods, subjects viewed the same hands sliding from side to side without tapping movements of the fingers. No sound was provided. Sequences of key presses during task periods consisted of pieces of familiar music, unfamiliar music, or random sequences. Well-trained subjects were able to identify the familiar music, whereas less-trained subjects were not. The left PT of the well-trained subjects was equally activated by observation of familiar music, unfamiliar music, and random sequences. The na{\"\i}ve and less trained groups did not show activation of the left PT during any of the tasks. These results suggest that PT activation reflects a learned process. As the activation was elicited by viewing key pressing actions regardless of whether they constituted a piece of music, the PT may be involved in processes that occur prior to the identification of a piece of music, that is, mapping the complex sequence structure of hand movements onto the sequence of sounds.},

abstract = {Steady-state responses can be recorded from the human scalp in response to tones that are sinusoidally modulated in amplitude at rates between 60 and 120 Hz. For 60 dB SPL 1000-Hz tones the maximum baseline-to-peak amplitude of about 0.06 microV occurs for modulation rates between 80 and 95 Hz. The phase of the response does not change with modulation depths greater than 25% and the amplitude saturates at modulation depths greater than 50%. The presence or absence of a response can be accurately determined by frequency-domain statistics and the response becomes clearly recognizable at intensities that are 16 +/- 8 dB above behavioral thresholds. With increasing intensity the response increases in amplitude at 1.9 nV/dB until an intensity of 70 dB SPL. As the intensity increases above 70 dB SPL the response increases in amplitude more rapidly at 7.8 nV/dB (at 1000 Hz) and contains significant energy at harmonics of the modulation frequency. This second stage of the intensity function is more prominent for stimuli with lower carrier frequencies (500 more than 1000 more than 2000 Hz) and is attenuated by high-pass masking. These steady-state responses should be helpful in evaluating human auditory physiology and in objective audiometry.},

abstract = {Reciprocal synapses are characterized by the presence of both afferent and efferent types of synaptic specializations between two cells. They have been described at the neural poles of outer hair cells (OHCs) in humans with advanced age and two monkey species. Our objective was to study the innervation of the OHCs and determine if reciprocal synapses were present in a young (8-month-old infant) human subject. We studied the synaptic and cytoplasmic morphology of 162 nerve terminals innervating 29 OHCs using serial section transmission electron microscopy. Seventy-six percent of all OHCs were innervated by terminals with reciprocal synapses. This prevalence increased from the first toward the third row (p < 0.001), and 100% of OHCs in the third row demonstrated at least one reciprocal synapse. The prevalence of terminals with reciprocal synapses was higher in the human infant than in older human subjects and was very similar to what has been reported for the chimpanzee. Reciprocal synapses occur in sufficient numbers to be physiologically significant in primates. The nerve terminals were found to segregate into two groups on the basis of their cytoplasmic morphological characteristics: (1) vesicle-rich/neurofilament-poor (VR/NP) and (2) vesicle-poor/neurofilament-rich (VP/NR). All afferent and reciprocal terminals were of the VP/NR variety. The majority of the efferent terminals originated from VR/NP nerve fibers (classical olivocochlear morphology), but 23.5% of the efferent terminals were VP/NR. The hypothesis that peripheral processes of type II spiral ganglion cells form classical afferent, reciprocal, and a number of purely presynaptic terminals on OHCs is discussed. The presence of different types of synaptic specializations on OHCs formed by nerve fibers of the same type (VP/NR) suggests the existence of reciprocal neuronal circuits between OHCs sharing the dendritic arborization of a type II spiral ganglion cell.},

abstract = {Although most recent multitalker research has emphasized the importance of binaural cues, monaural cues can play an equally important role in the perception of multiple simultaneous speech signals. In this experiment, the intelligibility of a target phrase masked by a single competing masker phrase was measured as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with same-talker, same-sex, and different-sex target and masker voices. The results indicate that informational masking, rather than energetic masking, dominated performance in this experiment. The amount of masking was highly dependent on the similarity of the target and masker voices: performance was best when different-sex talkers were used and worst when the same talker was used for target and masker. Performance did not, however, improve monotonically with increasing SNR. Intelligibility generally plateaued at SNRs below 0 dB and, in some cases, intensity differences between the target and masking voices produced substantial improvements in performance with decreasing SNR. The results indicate that informational and energetic masking play substantially different roles in the perception of competing speech messages.},

abstract = {The cholinergic efferent fibers to the outer hair cells (OHCs) of the mammalian cochlea suppress sound-evoked activity of the auditory nerve on two time scales via one nicotinic receptor. A rapid action (tens of milliseconds) is responsible for modulating auditory nerve responses to acoustic stimulation. A slower action (tens of seconds) may protect the ear from acoustic overstimulation. The rapid action is likely caused by calcium influx through the nicotinic receptor that leads to opening of calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels, but the mechanism of the slower action has not been explained. To investigate this mechanism, we perfused the cochlea with agents that alter intracellular calcium release and uptake. Both fast and slow effects were enhanced by perfusion of the cochlea with ryanodine, an agonist of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). Antagonists of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), cyclopiazonic acid, and thapsigargin (1) selectively enhanced the magnitude of slow effects, (2) prevented the diminution of slow effects with continued efferent stimulation, and (3) spread the range of frequencies over which slow effects were observed. We propose that the slow effect is attributable to release of calcium from the subsurface cisterna of the OHC, perhaps triggered by CICR from the synaptic cisterna; the two time scales of efferent action may result from the unique arrangement of the two cisternae in the baso-lateral region of the OHC.},

abstract = {Active cochlear micromechanisms, involved in auditory sensitivity, are modulated by the medial olivocochlear efferent system, which projects directly onto the organ of Corti. Both processes can be assessed non-invasively by means of evoked otoacoustic emissions. Animal experiments have revealed top-down control from the auditory cortex to peripheral auditory receptor, supported by anatomical descriptions of descending auditory pathways from auditory areas to the medial olivocochlear efferent system and organ of Corti. Through recording of evoked otoacoustic emissions during presurgical functional brain mapping for refractory epilepsy, we showed that corticofugal modulation of peripheral auditory activity also exists in humans. In 10 epileptic patients, electrical stimulation of the contralateral auditory cortex led to a significant decrease in evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude, whereas no change occurred under stimulation of non-auditory contralateral areas. These findings provide evidence of a cortico-olivocochlear pathway, originating in the auditory cortex and modulating contralateral active cochlear micromechanisms via the medial olivocochlear efferent system, in humans.},

abstract = {Filter theory indicates that changes in cochlear filter bandwidths are accompanied by changes in cochlear response latencies. Previous reports indicate that otoacoustic emission (OAE) delays are reduced by exciting medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents with contralateral broad-band noise (CBBN). These delay reductions are consistent with MOC-induced widening of cochlear filters. We quantified the MOC-induced changes in human cochlear filter-related delays using stimulus-frequency and click-evoked OAEs (SFOAE and CEOAEs), recorded with and without MOC activity elicited by 60dB SPL CBBN. MOC-induced delay changes were measured from the slopes of SFOAE phase functions and from cross-correlation of 500Hz-wide CEOAE frequency-band waveform magnitudes. The delay changes measured from CEOAEs and SFOAEs were statistically indistinguishable. Both showed greater delay reductions at lower frequencies (a 5% decrease in the 0.5-2kHz frequency region). These data indicate that cochlear filters are widened 5% by the MOC activity from moderate-level CBBN. Psychophysically, the large changes in cochlear response latencies, implied by the 0.5ms change in OAE delay at low frequencies, would have a profound effect on binaural localization if they were not balanced in the central nervous system, or by the MOC system producing similar changes in both ears.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the response of the human auditory cortex to the temporal amplitude-envelope of speech. Responses to the speech envelope could be useful for validating the neural encoding of intelligible speech, particularly during hearing aid fittings--because hearing aid gain and compression characteristics for ongoing speech should more closely resemble real world performance than for isolated brief syllables.

DESIGN:The speech envelope comprises energy changes corresponding to phonemic and syllabic transitions. Envelope frequencies between 2 and 20 Hz are important for speech intelligibility. Human event-related potentials were recorded to six different sentences and the sources of these potentials in the auditory cortex were determined. To improve the signal to noise ratio over ongoing electroencephalographic recordings, we averaged the responses over multiple presentations, and derived source waveforms from multichannel scalp recordings. Source analysis led to bilateral, symmetrical, vertical, and horizontal dipoles in the posterior auditory cortices. The source waveforms were then cross-correlated with the low frequency log-envelopes of the sentences. The significance and latency of the maximum correlation for each sentence demonstrated the presence and latency of the brain's response. The source waveforms were also cross-correlated with a simple model based on a series of overlapping transient responses to stimulus change (the derivative of the log-envelope).

RESULTS:Correlations between the log-envelope and vertical dipole source waveforms were significant for all sentences and for all but one of the participants (mean r = 0.35), at an average delay of 175 (left) to 180 (right) msec. Correlations between the transient response model (P1 at 68 msec, N1 at 124 msec, and P2 at 208 msec) and the vertical dipole source waveforms were detected for all sentences and all participants (mean r = 0.30), at an average delay of 6 (right) to 10 (left) msec.

CONCLUSIONS:These results show that the human auditory cortex either directly follows the speech envelope or consistently reacts to changes in this envelope. The delay between the envelope and the response is approximately 180 msec.},

abstract = {Click evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) are commonly used both in research and clinics to assay the medial olivocochlear system (MOC). Clicks presented at rates >50 Hz in the contralateral ear have previously been reported to evoke contralateral MOC activity. However, in typical MOC assays, clicks are presented in the ipsilateral ear in conjunction with MOC elicitor (noise) in the contralateral ear. The effect of click rates in such an arrangement is currently unknown. A forward masking paradigm was used to emulate typical MOC assays to elucidate the influence of ipsilateral click presentation rates on MOC inhibition of CEOAEs in 28 normal hearing adults. Influence of five click rates (20.83, 25, 31.25, 41.67, and 62.5 Hz) presented at 55 dB peSPL was tested. Results indicate that click rates as low as 31.25 Hz significantly enhance contralateral MOC inhibition, possibly through the activation of ipsilateral and binaural MOC neurons with potential contributions from the middle ear muscle reflex. Therefore, click rates $\le$25 Hz are recommended for use in MOC assays, at least for 55 dB peSPL click level.},

Acoust. Soc. Am. 103, 3082 (1998)]. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for Harvard IEEE sentences presented from the front in the presence of one, two, or three interfering sources. Four types of interferer were used: (1) other sentences spoken by the same talker, (2) time-reversed sentences of the same talker, (3) speech-spectrum shaped noise, and (4) speech-spectrum shaped noise, modulated by the temporal envelope of the sentences. Each interferer was matched to the spectrum of the target talker. Interferers were placed in several spatial configurations, either coincident with or separated from the target. Binaural advantage was derived by subtracting SRTs from listening with the "better monaural ear" from those for binaural listening. For a single interferer, there was a binaural advantage of 2-4 dB for all interferer types. For two or three interferers, the advantage was 2-4 dB for noise and speech-modulated noise, and 6-7 dB for speech and time-reversed speech. These data suggest that the benefit of binaural hearing for speech intelligibility is especially pronounced when there are multiple voiced interferers at different locations from the target, regardless of spatial configuration; measurements with fewer or with other types of interferers can underestimate this benefit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:In this study, procedures for measuring sound localization, sound lateralization, and binaural masking level differences (BMLDs) in young children were developed. Sensitivity for these tasks was assessed in large groups of children between 4 and 9 yr of age to investigate potential developmental trends.

DESIGN:Sound localization was measured in the sound field, with a broadband bell-ring presented from one of nine loudspeakers positioned in the frontal horizontal field. A group of 33 children between 4 and 6 yr of age and 5 adults took part in this experiment. Sound lateralization based on interaural time differences was measured with headphones in 49 children between 4 and 9 yr of age and 10 adults. A low-frequency stimulus containing harmonics 2 to 5 from a click train with a rate of 160 Hz was used. In the BMLD test, the same filtered click train was presented diotically or dichotically (phase reversed or time delayed) in a broadband (200 to 1000 Hz) frozen noise to 23 children between 4 and 6 yr of age and 10 adults. For comparison with literature, additional measurements with a 500-Hz sinusoid were administered to adults. All tasks were adapted to the interest and attention span of young children.

RESULTS:Children of 5 yr of age did not perform significantly different from adults on the sound localization task, but mean absolute errors were larger for the 4-yr-olds. Also on the BMLD task, 5-yr-old children performed at the adult level, whereas the 4-yr-old children obtained significantly less binaural unmasking compared with the adults. Concerning sound lateralization, a small but significant difference between adults and children existed, but no age effects were apparent in the 4- to 9-yr-old group. Overall, the variation was relatively large in the 4-yr-old group, with some of the children performing at adult level, in all three tasks.

CONCLUSIONS:The results of this study show that the modified procedures are suitable for testing children from the age of 4 to 5 yr. Furthermore, it seems that binaural hearing capacities of the 5-yr-olds are similar to those of adults. Several observations led to the hypothesis that the observed age differences between 4-yr-olds and older subjects on localization and BMLD or between those 4- to 9-yr old and adults on lateralization, were attributable to both a development in binaural hearing and to nonauditory factors, such as task comprehension, attention, and testing conditions. It is possible that the developmental process is more obvious and prolonged in other aspects of binaural hearing, which require more dynamic or more central processing.},

abstract = {The ability of listeners to {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}glimpse{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} acoustic cues during the quieter sections of an interrupted noise has primarily been studied using maskers with interruptions occurring simultaneously across the entire frequency range of the masker{\textemdash}broadband comodulated interruptions. Here, the possibility of uncomodulated glimpsing (the glimpsing of acoustic cues separated both in time and frequency) was investigated. To achieve this, speech reception thresholds for a set of intervocalic consonants were adaptively measured in 100-Hz to 10-kHz pink noise divided into a varying number of frequency bands of equal energy. In uncomodulated noise conditions, the odd and even numbered bands were switched on and off alternately at a rate of 10 Hz. The spectrograms of such noises (on log frequency scales), resemble portions of a checkerboard. Glimpsing in {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}checkerboard{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} noise was found with maskers divided into two and four bands, but not into eight bands or more. Further investigations showed that, in the two-band case, this release from masking was indeed due to uncomodulated glimpsing, and not simply attributable to glimpsing in one of the modulated bands. In the four-band case, the release from masking in checkerboard noise can be accounted for without recourse to uncomodulated glimpsing. Interestingly, conditions which allowed glimpsing resulted in greater intersubject variability. The implications of these results for quantitative analyses of masker fluctuations are discussed.},

abstract = {Although some findings suggest that auditory efferent fibers are involved in perception in noise, their function remains controversial. The contralateral suppression of evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs) has recently provided a means of exploring the medial olivocochlear system (MOCS) in humans. In an experiment based on this paradigm, the present study examined the relationships between variations of both EOAEs and detection-in-noise thresholds, induced in the same subjects by a contralateral 50-dB-SPL broad-band noise masker. EOAEs were recorded in response to a burst of a multitone complex composed of 1, 1.5 and 2-kHz components. The detection thresholds of this 3-component complex were measured at 2 ipsilateral noise levels: 50 and 70 dB SPL. The main finding was a significant correlation between EOAE suppression and threshold variations under contralateral masking. A relationship was also found between the contralateral suppression of EOAEs and threshold variation induced by the increase in ipsilateral noise level. These findings support the notion that the MOCS is involved in the detection of multicomponent stimuli in noise.},

abstract = {This article reviews several aspects of auditory perception that are affected by hearing loss of cochlear origin. It is argued that most of the observed effects can be understood in terms of damage to a physiologically vulnerable active process in the cochlea. In a normal ear, this process enhances sensitivity and frequency selectivity and reduces the slope of the input-output function on the basilar membrane. Damage to the active process in impaired ears leads to reduced sensitivity and frequency selectivity, an abnormally rapid rate of growth of loudness with intensity, reduced temporal integration and, for certain types of stimuli, reduced temporal resolution. The implications and relevance of each of these effects to the design and fitting of hearing aids are discussed.},

abstract = {Analysis of neural interactions explains the activation of occipital cortex by an auditory stimulus. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 2790-2796, 1998. Large-scale neural interactions were characterized in human subjects as they learned that an auditory stimulus signaled a visual event. Once learned, activation of left dorsal occipital cortex (increased regional cerebral blood flow) was observed when the auditory stimulus was presented alone. Partial least-squares analysis of the interregional correlations (functional connectivity) between the occipital area and the rest of the brain identified a pattern of covariation with four dominant brain areas that could have mediated this activation: prefrontal cortex (near Brodmann area 10, A10), premotor cortex (A6), superior temporal cortex (A41/42), and contralateral occipital cortex (A18). Interactions among these regions and the occipital area were quantified with structural equation modeling to identify the strongest sources of the effect on left occipital activity (effective connectivity). Learning-related changes in feedback effects from A10 and A41/42 appeared to account for this change in occipital activity. Influences from these areas on the occipital area were initially suppressive, or negative, becoming facilitory, or positive, as the association between the auditory and visual stimuli was acquired. Evaluating the total effects within the functional models showed positive influences throughout the network, suggesting enhanced interactions may have primed the system for the now-expected visual discrimination. By characterizing both changes in activity and the interactions underlying sensory associative learning, we demonstrated how parts of the nervous system operate as a cohesive network in learning about and responding to the environment.},

abstract = {The speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (speech ABR) is widely considered to provide an index of the quality of neural temporal encoding in the central auditory pathway. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the extent to which the speech ABR is shaped by spectral processing in the cochlea. High-pass noise masking was used to record speech ABRs from delimited octave-wide frequency bands between 0.5 and 8 kHz in normally-hearing young adults. The latency of the frequency-delimited responses decreased from the lowest to the highest frequency band by up to 3.6 ms. The observed frequency-latency function was compatible with model predictions based on wave V of the click ABR. The frequency-delimited speech ABR amplitude was largest in the 2-4 kHz frequency band, and decreased towards both higher and lower frequency bands, despite the predominance of low-frequency energy in the speech stimulus. We argue that the frequency-dependence of speech ABR latency and amplitude results from the decrease in cochlear filter width with decreasing frequency. The results suggest that the amplitude and latency of the speech ABR may reflect inter-individual differences in cochlear, as well as central, processing. The high-pass noise masking technique provides a useful tool for differentiating between peripheral and central effects on the speech ABR. It can be used for further elucidating the neural basis of the perceptual speech deficits that have been associated with individual differences in speech ABR characteristics.},

abstract = {It is generally believed that the remarkable sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing depend on outer hair cell-generated force, which amplifies sound-induced vibrations inside the cochlea. This 'reverse transduction' force production has never been demonstrated experimentally, however, in the living ear. Here by directly measuring microstructure vibrations inside the cochlear partition using a custom-built interferometer, we demonstrate that electrical stimulation can evoke both fast broadband and slow sharply tuned responses of the reticular lamina, but only a slow tuned response of the basilar membrane. Our results indicate that outer hair cells can generate sufficient force to drive the reticular lamina over all audible frequencies in living cochleae. Contrary to expectations, the cellular force causes a travelling wave rather than an immediate local vibration of the basilar membrane; this travelling wave vibrates in phase with the reticular lamina at the best frequency, and results in maximal vibration at the apical ends of outer hair cells.},

abstract = {Permanent noise-induced damage to the inner ear is a major cause of hearing impairment, arising from exposures occurring during both work- and pleasure-related activities. Vulnerability to noise-induced hearing loss is highly variable: some have tough, whereas others have tender ears. This report documents, in an animal model, the efficacy of a simple nontraumatic assay of normal ear function in predicting vulnerability to acoustic injury. The assay measures the strength of a sound-evoked neuronal feedback pathway to the inner ear, the olivocochlear efferents, by examining otoacoustic emissions created by the normal ear, which can be measured with a microphone in the external ear. Reflex strength was inversely correlated with the degree of hearing loss after subsequent noise exposure. These data suggest that one function of the olivocochlear efferent system is to protect the ear from acoustic injury. This assay, or a simple modification of it, could be applied to human populations to screen for individuals most at risk in noisy environments.},

However, our experience in the world involves constant multisensory stimulation. For instance, visual and auditory information are integrated in performing many tasks that involve localizing and tracking moving objects. Therefore, it is likely that the human brain has evolved to develop, learn and operate optimally in multisensory environments. We suggest that training protocols that employ unisensory stimulus regimes do not engage multisensory learning mechanisms and, therefore, might not be optimal for learning. However, multisensory-training protocols can better approximate natural settings and are more effective for learning.},

abstract = {The traditional belief is that the event-related alpha response can solely be described in terms of suppression or event-related desynchronization (ERD). Recent research, however, has shown that under certain conditions alpha responds reliably with an increase in amplitudes (event-related synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where subjects withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over sites that probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we assume that alpha ERS reflects top-down, inhibitory control processes. This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our hypothesis. By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes reflect rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons. Thus, the time and direction of a change - described by phase - is functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation processes. A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha phase coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase lag lies within a time range that is consistent with neuronal transmission speed. Another implication is that phase reset will be a powerful mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally sensitive measure that is related to cognitive performance. Our general conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active role for the inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation processes.},

abstract = {The reliability of nine measures of the stimulus level in the human ear canal was compared by measuring the sensitivity of behavioral hearing thresholds to changes in the depth of insertion of an otoacoustic emission probe. Four measures were the ear-canal pressure, the eardrum pressure estimated from it and the pressure measured in an ear simulator with and without compensation for insertion depth. The remaining five quantities were derived from the ear-canal pressure and the Th{\'e}venin-equivalent source characteristics of the probe: Forward pressure, initial forward pressure, the pressure transmitted into the middle ear, eardrum sound pressure estimated by summing the magnitudes of the forward and reverse pressure (integrated pressure) and absorbed power. Two sets of behavioral thresholds were measured in 26 subjects from 0.125 to 20 kHz, with the probe inserted at relatively deep and shallow positions in the ear canal. The greatest dependence on insertion depth was for transmitted pressure and absorbed power. The measures with the least dependence on insertion depth throughout the frequency range (best performance) included the depth-compensated simulator, eardrum, forward, and integrated pressures. Among these, forward pressure is advantageous because it quantifies stimulus phase.},

We tracked DPOAE postonset adaptation as a metric of MOC reflex strength, before during and after induction of anesthesia in guinea pigs. Reflex strength was significantly diminished by the barbiturate/neuroleptic anesthesia most commonly used in this species. The MOC reflex recovered more slowly than toe-pinch or startle reflexes, correlating better with recovery of general mobility. When individual anesthetic agents were assessed, the barbiturate (pentobarbital) significantly diminished MOC reflex strength, whereas fentanyl or droperidol did not. These results suggest that previous studies using anesthetized preparations may have underestimated the magnitude of sound-evoked responses in the OC pathway.},

abstract = {Single medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons were recorded from the cochlea of the anesthetized guinea pig. We used tones and noise presented monaurally and binaurally and measured responses for sounds up to 105 dB sound pressure level (SPL). For monaural sound, MOC neuron firing rates were usually higher for noise bursts than tone bursts, a situation not observed for afferent fibers of the auditory nerve that were sampled in the same preparations. MOC neurons also differed from afferent fibers in having less saturation of response. Some MOC neurons had responses that continued to increase even at high sound levels. Differences between MOC and afferent responses suggest that there is convergence in the pathway to olivocochlear neurons, possibly a combination of inputs that are at the characteristic frequency (CF) with others that are off the CF. Opposite-ear noise almost always facilitated the responses of MOC neurons to sounds in the main ear, the ear that best drives the unit. This binaural facilitation depends on several characteristics that pertain to the main ear: it is higher in neurons having a contralateral main ear (contra units), it is higher at main-ear sound levels that are moderate (approximately 65 dB SPL), and it is higher in neurons with low discharge rates to main-ear stimuli. Facilitation also depends on parameters of the opposite-ear sound: facilitation increases with noise level in the opposite ear until saturating, is greater for continuous noise than noise bursts, and is usually greater for noise than for tones. Using optimal opposite-ear facilitators and high-level stimuli, the firing rates of olivocochlear neurons range up to 140 spikes/s, whereas for moderate-level monaural stimuli the rates are <80 spikes/s. At high sound levels, firing rates of olivocochlear neurons increase with CF, an increase that may compensate for the known lower effectiveness of olivocochlear synapses on outer hair cells responding to high frequencies. Overall, our results demonstrate a high MOC response for binaural noise and suggest a prominent role for the MOC system in environments containing binaural noise of high level.},

abstract = {Contralateral masking occurs when the threshold of a signal in one ear is elevated by the presence of a masker in the other, contralateral ear. The classic data and theory on contralateral masking were provided by Zwislocki [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 52, 644-659 (1972)] who observed a 3- to 18-dB threshold shift (masking) for a gated pure-tone signal in one ear when a gated pure-tone masker was presented via insert earphones to the other ear. Zwislocki referred to this phenomenon as "central masking." Here, using two psychophysical methods (Yes-No; two-interval forced-choice), Zwislocki's original results, obtained with other psychophysical methods, were successfully replicated. Similar results using several psychophysical methods suggest that contralateral masking is indicative of a sensory phenomenon rather than observer bias and other response proclivities. In a second experiment, psychophysical tuning curves were obtained using either an ipsilateral masker or a contralateral masker. Tuning curves obtained with a contralateral masker had steeper slopes on both the low- and high-frequency sides than tuning curves obtained with an ipsilateral masker. Thus, although substantially smaller in effect than ipsilateral masking, contralateral masking is more sharply tuned. The sharp tuning of contralateral masking reflects a greater compression of the input/output functions for contralateral masking than for ipsilateral masking. The closest correspondence between the tuning curves reported here for contralateral masking and those predicted by Zwislocki's theory and data (on central masking) occurred for tuning curves where the ratio of driven activity to spontaneous activity was about six. A remaining issue is the role, if any, of the efferent auditory system, especially the olivocochlear bundle, in threshold shifts measured using the Zwislocki (central masking) paradigm.},

abstract = {1. Centrifugal control of many sensory systems is well established, notably in the gamma motorneuron of skeletal muscle stretch receptors. 2. Efferent (olivocochlear) innervation of the mammalian cochlea was first established through anatomical studies. Histological studies confirmed synaptic terminals in contact with hair cells and afferent dendrites. 3. Electrophysiology has elucidated the cellular mechanisms of efferent modulation in the cochlea. 4. The system has potential roles in noise protection, homeostatic feedback control of cochlear function and signal processing. There is some evidence in support of each, but also contraindications. 5. It is concluded that the role of the olivocochlear innervation is still contentious but, on balance, the evidence appears to favour a role in enhancing signal detection in noise.},

abstract = {Function of the olivocochlear reflex, measured by suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, is assessed in nine patients with bilateral auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony and compared to matched control subjects with normal auditory function. TEOAEs were acquired using 65 dB peak sound pressure linear clicks with and without the presence of broad-band noise presented binaurally, ipsilaterally, or contralaterally in a forward masking paradigm. Efferent suppression differed significantly between subject groups (p < .0001). Mean suppression was less than 0.22 dB across all suppressor noise conditions for the auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony subjects. TEOAE suppression averaged 4.47 (binaural), 2.41 (ipsilateral), and 1.52 (contralateral) dB in the control subjects. Suppression characteristics across the three suppressor conditions were also assessed in one patient with unilateral auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony. The results suggest that poor efferent responses are related to compromised afferent input to the OCR pathway and support the use of efferent suppression of otoacoustic emissions as a differential measure of auditory function in patients with auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony.},

abstract = {The Listening in Spatialized Noise test (LISN) produces a virtual three-dimensional auditory environment under headphones. Various measures assess the extent to which either spatial, vocal, or spatial and vocal cues combined increase a listener's ability to comprehend a target story in the presence of distracter sentences, without being affected by differences between participants in variables such as linguistic skills. Ten children at risk for auditory processing disorder (APD group) were assessed on the LISN, as well as a traditional APD test battery. The APD group performed significantly more poorly on all LISN measures than 48 age-matched controls. On the spatial advantage measure, the APD group achieved a mean advantage of only 3.7 dB when the distracters were spatially separated from the target by +/-90 degrees, compared to 10.0 dB for the controls-the 6.3 dB difference significant at p < 0.000001, with nine children scoring outside the normal range. The LISN was considered a promising addition to an APD test battery.},

abstract = {Physiological studies of spatial hearing show that the spatial receptive fields of cortical neurons typically are narrow at near-threshold levels, broadening at moderate levels. The apparent loss of neuronal spatial selectivity at increasing sound levels conflicts with the accurate performance of human subjects localizing at moderate sound levels. In the present study, human sound localization was evaluated across a wide range of sensation levels, extending down to the detection threshold. Listeners reported whether they heard each target sound and, if the target was audible, turned their heads to face the apparent source direction. Head orientation was tracked electromagnetically. At near-threshold levels, the lateral (left/right) components of responses were highly variable and slightly biased towards the midline, and front vertical components consistently exhibited a strong bias towards the horizontal plane. Stimulus levels were specified relative to the detection threshold for a front-positioned source, so low-level rear targets often were inaudible. As the sound level increased, first lateral and then vertical localization neared asymptotic levels. The improvement of localization over a range of increasing levels, in which neural spatial receptive fields presumably are broadening, indicates that sound localization does not depend on narrow spatial receptive fields of cortical neurons.},

abstract = {This report documents slow changes in cochlear responses produced by electrical stimulation of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB), which provides efferent innervation to the hair cells of the cochlea. These slow changes have time constants of 25-50 sec, three orders of magnitude slower than those reported previously. Such "slow effects" are similar to classically described "fast effects" in that (1) they comprise a suppression of the compound action potential (CAP) of the auditory nerve mirrored by an enhancement of the cochlear microphonic potential (CM) generated largely by the outer hair cells; (2) the magnitude of suppression decreases as the intensity of the acoustic stimulus increases; (3) they share the same dependence on OCB stimulation rate; (4) both are extinguished upon cutting the OCB; and (5) both are blocked with similar concentrations of a variety of cholinergic antagonists as well as with strychnine and bicuculline. These observations suggest that both fast and slow effects are mediated by the same receptor and are produced by conductance changes in outer hair cells. Slow effects differ from fast effects in that (1) fast effects are greatest for acoustic stimulus frequencies between 6 and 10 kHz, whereas slow effects peak for frequencies from 12 to 16 kHz, and (2) fast effects persist over long periods of OCB stimulation, whereas slow effects diminish after 60 sec of stimulation. The time course of the slow effects can be described mathematically by assuming that each shock-burst produces, in addition to a fast effect, a small decrease in CAP amplitude that decays exponentially with a time constant that is long relative to the intershock interval. The long time constant of the slow effect compared to the fast effect suggests that it may arise from a distinct intracellular mechanism, possibly mediated by second-messenger systems.},

abstract = {Reading disability is associated with phonological problems which might originate in auditory processing disorders. The aim of the present study was 2-fold: first, the perceptual skills of average-reading children and children with dyslexia were compared in a categorical perception task assessing the processing of a phonemic contrast based on voice onset time (VOT). The medial olivocochlear (MOC) system, an inhibitory pathway functioning under central control, was also explored. Secondly, we investigated whether audiovisual training focusing on voicing contrast could modify VOT sensitivity and, in parallel, induce MOC system plasticity. The results showed an altered voicing sensitivity in some children with dyslexia, and that the most severely impaired children presented the most severe reading difficulties. These deficits in VOT perception were sometimes accompanied by MOC function abnormalities, in particular a reduction in or even absence of the asymmetry in favour of the right ear found in average-reading children. Audiovisual training significantly improved reading and shifted the categorical perception curve of certain children with dyslexia towards the average-reading children's pattern of voicing sensitivity. Likewise, in certain children MOC functioning showed increased asymmetry in favour of the right ear following audiovisual training. The training-related improvements in reading score were greatest in children presenting the greatest changes in MOC lateralization. Taken together, these results confirm the notion that some auditory system processing mechanisms are impaired in children with dyslexia and that audiovisual training can diminish these deficits.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying the ability of human listeners to recognize speech in the presence of background noise are still imperfectly understood. However, there is mounting evidence that the medial olivocochlear system plays an important role, via efferents that exert a suppressive effect on the response of the basilar membrane. The current paper presents a computer modeling study that investigates the possible role of this activity on speech intelligibility in noise. A model of auditory efferent processing [Ferry, R. T., and Meddis, R. (2007). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 122, 3519-3526] is used to provide acoustic features for a statistical automatic speech recognition system, thus allowing the effects of efferent activity on speech intelligibility to be quantified. Performance of the "basic" model (without efferent activity) on a connected digit recognition task is good when the speech is uncorrupted by noise but falls when noise is present. However, recognition performance is much improved when efferent activity is applied. Furthermore, optimal performance is obtained when the amount of efferent activity is proportional to the noise level. The results obtained are consistent with the suggestion that efferent suppression causes a "release from adaptation" in the auditory-nerve response to noisy speech, which enhances its intelligibility.},

Experiments were conducted in an anechoic chamber with a leading stimulus delivered from a loudspeaker at 45 degrees to the right of center and a lagging stimulus from 45 degrees left. Lead and lag stimuli were 4-ms bursts of Gaussian noise. In experiment 1, with lead and lag at equal levels and the lag delay fixed at 2 ms, the perceived location of the image produced by the lead-lag stimulus was estimated from subjects' left/right judgments relative to bursts from a "comparitor" loudspeaker whose position could be adjusted. In experiment 2, the dominance of the leading burst on perceived location was measured by determining the increase in level of the lagging burst necessary to produce an image estimated to be centered at 0 degree azimuth. Experiment 3 was concerned with echo threshold. Subjects reported whether or not they heard a sound in the vicinity of the lagging loudspeaker as the lag-burst delay was varied. In all three experiments, data were obtained for four to five stimulus levels in quiet and for three levels of background white noise from a loudspeaker at 180 degrees. The results revealed a substantial weakening effect of background noise on the precedence effect in experiments 2 and 3, and a nonsignificant effect in experiment 1.},

abstract = {1. Responses of single fibers were obtained from the auditory nerve of chinchillas. Tone-burst stimuli consisted of a masking stimulus followed by a probe stimulus. Forward masking of a fiber's response is defined as a reduction in the magnitude of the probe-evoked response caused by the addition of the masking stimulus. 2. The recovery of probe response magnitude as a function of the time interval between masker offset and probe onset (delta T) follows an exponential time course. A relationship between the time course or magnitude of poststimulus recovery and the characteristic frequency (CF) of a fiber was not detected. 3. The iso-forward masking contour near the threshold of the masking effect across masker frequencies approximates a fiber's frequency threshold curve (FTC). In other words, forward masking tuning curves are essentially the same as frequency threshold curves. 4. The frequency dependence of forward masking is compared to that of two-tone suppression. Tonal stimuli outside the boundaries of a fiber's FTC that produce two-tone suppression are ineffective forward maskers. Certain frequency/intensity combinations within the FTC may produce both suppression and forward masking and tones within the remaining area of the FTC produce no suppression but are effective forward maskers. 5. Both the time course and the magnitude of the forward masking effect are dependent on the discharge rate evoked by the masker regardless of the masker's absolute level or spectral content. An increase in masker-evoked excitation causes an increase in time constant and a greater reduction in probe response magnitude, rd. The function relating rd to masker level parallels the firing rate/masker level function up to 40 dB above response threshold. 6. A decrease in masker duration from 100 ms leads to a decrease in both rd and the time constant of recovery. There is no significant difference between the 100 and 200 ms duration conditions. 7. Forward masking in single fibers is related to the period of poststimulus recovery of spontaneous activity, a component of a fiber's response pattern to the masker, and this component is tentatively identified as a period of recovery from short-term adaptation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To study whether a change in cochlear tuning, measured using OAEs, could be detected due to contralateral activation of the efferent system using broadband noise.

DESIGN:Cochlear tuning measures based on SFOAE phase gradients and SFOAE-2TS 'Q' were used to test this hypothesis. SFOAE magnitude and phase gradient were measured using a pure-tone sweep from 1248 to 2496 Hz at 50 dB SPL. 2TS curves of SFOAE were recorded with a suppressor frequency swept from 1120 to 2080 Hz at 50 dB SPL. DPOAE f2-sweep phase gradient was also obtained to allow comparisons with the literature. All three assays were performed across with- and no-CAS conditions.

STUDY SAMPLE:Twenty-two young, normal-hearing adults.

RESULTS:CAS did not produce a statistically significant change in the tuning metric in any of the OAE methods used, despite producing significant reductions in the OAE magnitude.

CONCLUSION:It is unknown whether this insensitivity to CAS is due to an insensitivity of these three measures to cochlear mechanical tuning. The results suggest that any changes in tuning induced by CAS that may occur are small and difficult to detect using the OAE measurement paradigms used here.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) evoked by click stimuli were recorded in both ears of 20 normal human subjects, in the presence and absence of a contralateral masking broad band noise. No difference in the amplitude of OAE suppression was noted between the first tested ear and the second one. In addition, 20 pathological subjects were tested according to the same protocol. Ten of them belonged to a group of patients whose vestibular nerve was sectioned on one side to relieve incapacitating vertigo and thus represented a group in whom olivocochlear efferents were severed. A great reduction of suppression observed in the operated ear suggested that olivocochlear efferent fibers are necessary to obtain a full suppressive effect. Three of the pathological subjects were patients who had undergone a decompression of the facial nerve which necessitated the same surgical approach as vestibular neurotomy, but without any section of vestibular fibers. This surgical control group demonstrated that the surgical act by itself cannot explain the difference observed in the neurotomized group. Finally, seven of the pathological subjects were patients with Bell's palsy, which paralyses the facial nerve and abolishes the stapedial reflex. No suppression difference was observed between healthy ears and ears without stapedial reflex. Therefore, it appeared that the stapedial reflex was not involved in the contralateral suppression of EOAEs. However, as the tensor tympani muscle remained functional in these patients, its involvement in the suppressive effect cannot be excluded.},

abstract = {The presentation of contralateral noise during the recording of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) reduces the amplitude of the TEOAE in normally-hearing adults. This is known as TEOAE suppression. The present study investigated TEOAE suppression in 18 adults with learning disabilities (LDs) compared to 18 adults without LDs. TEOAEs were elicited by 60 dB p.e. SPL clicks and were suppressed by the presentation of 60 dB SPL contralateral broadband noise. Suppression was measured as a change in the overall TEOAE response amplitude, and also analysed in 2-ms epochs representing different TEOAE frequency-response bands. A significant interaction was evident between group type and ear tested. Participants in the control group had right ear dominance for the suppression effect, whereas the left ear was found to be dominant for the LD group. These findings suggest a mechanism of the medial olivary cochlear bundle and efferent auditory pathway that differs in those with LD compared to those with typical learning abilities.},

abstract = {In mammals, efferent projections to the cochlear receptor are constituted by olivocochlear (OC) fibers that originate in the superior olivary complex. Medial and lateral OC neurons make synapses with outer hair cells and with auditory nerve fibers, respectively. In addition to the OC system, there are also descending projections from the auditory cortex that are directed towards the thalamus, inferior colliculus, cochlear nucleus, and superior olivary complex. Olivocochlear function can be assessed by measuring a brainstem reflex mediated by auditory nerve fibers, cochlear nucleus neurons, and OC fibers. Although it is known that the OC reflex is activated by contralateral acoustic stimulation and produces a suppression of cochlear responses, the influence of cortical descending pathways in the OC reflex is largely unknown. Here, we used auditory cortex electrical microstimulation in chinchillas to study a possible cortical modulation of cochlear and auditory nerve responses to tones in the absence and presence of contralateral noise. We found that cortical microstimulation produces two different peripheral modulations: (i) changes in cochlear sensitivity evidenced by amplitude modulation of cochlear microphonics and auditory nerve compound action potentials and (ii) enhancement or suppression of the OC reflex strength as measured by auditory nerve responses, which depended on the intersubject variability of the OC reflex. Moreover, both corticofugal effects were not correlated, suggesting the presence of two functionally different efferent pathways. These results demonstrate that auditory cortex electrical microstimulation independently modulates the OC reflex strength and cochlear sensitivity.},

More pronounced suppression of TEOAE produced by ipsilateral masking could involve efferent-mediated effects along with effects of cochlear origin. However, this has not been investigated so far. Therefore, changes of click-evoked OAE under ipsi- and contralateral forward masking by clicks and noise-bursts were investigated in an extremely long-lasting experiment in one normal-hearing volunteer. The reduction of TEOAE under ipsilateral click-to-click forward masking was maximal during the first milliseconds after masker delivery implying that predominant role of the cochlear processes in TEOAE ipsilateral suppression. Ipsilateral forward masking by noise burst revealed additional TEOAE suppression with longer latency. Its time course was similar to that of the contralateral masking effect. The latter data suggest the involvement of the medial olivocochlear system in TEOAE ipsilateral suppression.},

abstract = {This paper describes low-frequency auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) to speech-weighted noise stimuli. The effect of modulation frequency was evaluated within the frequency range below 40 Hz. Furthermore, objective ASSR measures were related to speech understanding performance in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. The variability in ASSR recordings over independent test sessions was larger between subjects than within. Trends of increased responses around 10 and/or 20 Hz were found in all subjects. Obtained latency estimates of the responses pointed to primarily cortical sources involved in ASSR generation at low frequencies. Furthermore, significant differences between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults were found for ASSRs to stimuli related to the temporal envelope of speech. Comparing these responses with phoneme identification scores over different stimulus levels showed both measures increased with stimulus level in a similar way (rho=0.82). At a fixed stimulus level, ASSRs were significantly correlated with speech reception thresholds for phonemes and sentences in noise (rho from -0.45 to -0.53). These results indicate that objective low-frequency ASSRs are related to behavioral speech understanding, independently of level.},

abstract = {There are powerful pathways descending from the auditory cortex (AC) to the inferior colliculus (IC), yet their function is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a reversible cortical inactivation, achieved by cooling of the AC, on the responses of neurons in the rat IC. Extracellular single-unit or multi-unit activity was recorded in the IC of anaesthetized rats with a 16-channel multielectrode probe introduced along the IC dorso-ventral axis through the dorsal cortex (DCIC) to the central nucleus of the IC (CIC). Cooling of the AC produced an increase in spontaneous activity and magnitude of the sound-evoked response in 47% of the IC neurons. Maximal changes in the neuronal activity were observed in the DCIC and the central part of the CIC. The final segments of the sustained responses to 60 ms stimuli and the off responses were more affected than the onset segments. Inactivation of the AC resulted in a suppression of the post-excitatory inhibition and neuronal adaptation, which was reflected in a pronounced enhancement of synchronized responses to a series of fast repeated clicks. The response parameters recovered, at least partly, to the pre-cooling levels one hour after the cooling cessation. The frequency tuning properties of the IC neurons did not show any significant changes during the cooling period. The results demonstrate that AC cooling inactivates excitatory corticofugal pathways and results in a less activated intrinsic inhibitory network in the IC.},

Improvements in high-level sound localization associated with increased stimulus duration might result from temporal integration or from adaptation that might allow reliable processing of later portions of the stimulus. Free-field localization judgments were obtained for clicks and for 3- and 100-ms noise bursts presented at sensation levels from 30 to 55 dB. For the brief (clicks and 3-ms) stimuli, listeners showed compression of elevation judgments and increased rates and unusual patterns of front/back confusion at sensation levels higher than 40-45 dB. At lower sensation levels, brief sounds were localized accurately. The localization task was repeated using 3-ms noise burst targets in a background of spatially diffuse, wide-band noise intended to pre-adapt the system prior to the target onset. For high-level targets, the addition of background noise afforded mild release from the elevation compression effect. Finally, a train of identical, high-level, 3-ms bursts was found to be localized more accurately than a single burst. These results support the adaptation hypothesis.},

Neurophysiological data suggest that this transition occurs when the sensory input is mapped onto the physiological basis of sensory memory in the auditory cortex. At this point, the sensory information carried by the stimulus-elicited process corresponds, for the first time, to that contained by the actual sound percept. Before this stage, the sensory stimulus code is fragmentary, lacks the time dimension, cannot enter conscious perception, and is not accessible to top-down processes (voluntary mental operations).

abstract = {We used anterograde tracing techniques to characterize projections from auditory cortex to the superior olivary complex (SOC) in guinea pigs. Large injections of fluorescent or biotinylated dextrans into the temporal cortex labeled many axons in the SOC. Labeled boutons were most numerous in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, with additional boutons in all other olivary nuclei. The distribution of boutons was similar in the ipsilateral and contralateral SOC; however, the contralateral SOC had markedly fewer axons and boutons. Similar patterns of labeling were also observed following injections confined to primary auditory cortex or the dorsocaudal auditory field. Cortical axons in many of the SOC nuclei share numerous morphological features, suggesting that individual axons may innervate multiple nuclei and have widespread effects. In addition, some nuclei contain axons with branching or termination patterns unique to that nucleus; these axons may represent focused projections with effects limited to individual SOC nuclei. Given the many projections of SOC nuclei, cortico-olivary projections are in a position to modify the activity of many brainstem auditory circuits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The study was designed to assess the effects of background noise level on the detection and localization of speech.

DESIGN:The phrase "Where is this?" was presented either in quiet or in a diffuse noise field, through loudspeakers arranged in a 360 degrees azimuth array. The noise conditions included 11 signal to noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from -18 dB SNR to +12 dB SNR in 3 dB increments. Seventeen normal-hearing subjects, aged 18 to 29, participated in the study.

RESULTS:Results revealed that in all listening conditions the signal was most easily detected when presented through a loudspeaker positioned at 90 degrees or 270 degrees azimuth. Although the actual level for 50% detection varied as a function of loudspeaker location and SNR, 85% and 100% of all presentations of the signal were detected at -9 dB and -6 dB SNR, respectively. Localization accuracy improved as the SNR increased, ranging from 18% accuracy at -18 dB SNR to 89% at +12 dB SNR. Localization accuracy in quiet was 95%. The data are discussed in reference to patterns of responses at each loudspeaker location.

CONCLUSIONS:Detection of the target signal deteriorated as background noise level increased and was dependent on the source location of the incoming signal, as expected. Localization accuracy of the target signal was highly dependent on the SNR and spatial location of the signal source. Detection and localization accuracy data were found to be repeatable across test sessions and response patterns were found to be symmetrical on the right and left sides of the horizontal plane.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To review how the properties of sounds are "coded" in the normal auditory system and to discuss the extent to which cochlear implants can and do represent these codes.

DATA SOURCES:Data are taken from published studies of the response of the cochlea and auditory nerve to simple and complex stimuli, in both the normal and the electrically stimulated ear. REVIEW CONTENT: The review describes: 1) the coding in the normal auditory system of overall level (which partly determines perceived loudness), spectral shape (which partly determines perceived timbre and the identity of speech sounds), periodicity (which partly determines pitch), and sound location; 2) the role of the active mechanism in the cochlea, and particularly the fast-acting compression associated with that mechanism; 3) the neural response patterns evoked by cochlear implants; and 4) how the response patterns evoked by implants differ from those observed in the normal auditory system in response to sound. A series of specific issues is then discussed, including: 1) how to compensate for the loss of cochlear compression; 2) the effective number of independent channels in a normal ear and in cochlear implantees; 3) the importance of independence of responses across neurons; 4) the stochastic nature of normal neural responses; 5) the possible role of across-channel coincidence detection; and 6) potential benefits of binaural implantation.

CONCLUSIONS:Current cochlear implants do not adequately reproduce several aspects of the neural coding of sound in the normal auditory system. Improved electrode arrays and coding systems may lead to improved coding and, it is hoped, to better performance.},

abstract = {To enhance their mechanical sensitivity and frequency selectivity, hair cells amplify the mechanical stimuli to which they respond. Although cell-body contractions of outer hair cells are thought to mediate the active process in the mammalian cochlea, vertebrates without outer hair cells display highly sensitive, sharply tuned hearing and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. In these animals the amplifier must reside elsewhere. We report physiological evidence that amplification can stem from active movement of the hair bundle, the hair cell's mechanosensitive organelle. We performed experiments on hair cells from the sacculus of the bullfrog. Using a two-compartment recording chamber that permits exposure of the hair cell's apical and basolateral surfaces to different solutions, we examined active hair-bundle motion in circumstances similar to those in vivo. When the apical surface was bathed in artificial endolymph, many hair bundles exhibited spontaneous oscillations of amplitudes as great as 50 nm and frequencies in the range 5 to 40 Hz. We stimulated hair bundles with a flexible glass probe and recorded their mechanical responses with a photometric system. When the stimulus frequency lay within a band enclosing a hair cell's frequency of spontaneous oscillation, mechanical stimuli as small as +/-5 nm entrained the hair-bundle oscillations. For small stimuli, the bundle movement was larger than the stimulus. Because the energy dissipated by viscous drag exceeded the work provided by the stimulus probe, the hair bundles powered their motion and therefore amplified it.},

abstract = {1. Principal cells in the medial superior olive (MSO) receive low-frequency information from both ears via left and right cochlear nuclei. In vivo extracellular records suggest that some MSO neurons respond optimally only when the binaural acoustic signal has a precise interaural delay. Thus MSO cells, in particular principal cells, are thought to be the first stage in the processing of interaural time difference cues that provides information as to the location of a low-frequency sound in space. 2. Despite this proposed fundamental role for the MSO, certain features of this nucleus make in vivo recordings from any cell type here very difficult to obtain. Only a small number of extracellular records and no intracellular recordings are reported in the literature. Using sharp, neurobiotin-filled glass electrodes to record intracellularly from cells in an in vitro brain slice of the guinea pig superior olivary complex, I have begun to assess the anatomic and physiological features of cells in the MSO that might be relevant to such a functional role in vivo. 3. Two basic MSO cell types, designated principal and nonprincipal, could be distinguished on the basis of certain anatomic and physiological differences. 4. Labeled principal cell bodies were located at all dorsoventral location within the MSO. Labeled nonprincipal cells were located in or around the dorsal aspects of the nucleus. Principal cells typically had thick bipolar dendrites (1 directed medially, 1 laterally) that did not taper or branch significantly except at their terminations. Nonprincipal cells were multipolar with three to nine thinner primary dendrites that did not branch preferentially in a mediolateral direction. Principal cell axons gave off collaterals terminating in and around the dorsal MSO. Nonprincipal cells also had axon in and around the dorsal MSO. Nonprincipal cells also had axon collateral branches innervating dorsal MSO, but these axons could branch more extensively and project further down the dorsoventral aspect of the nucleus. 5. Principal cells typically responded to depolarizing current pulses with one or a few spikes at current onset. When bathed in saline containing 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), they fired repetitively to the same depolarizing current pulses. This would indicate a depolarization-induced nonlinearity similar to that seen in principal cell types of two other auditory brain stem nuclei, the anteroventral cochlear nucleus and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. Nonprincipal cells normally fired repetitively to depolarizing current pulses even close to spike threshold. Both cell types could show a sag in the membrane potential to hyperpolarizing current pulses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Accurate cochlear frequency-position functions based on physiological data would facilitate the interpretation of physiological and psychoacoustic data within and across species. Such functions might aid in developing cochlear models, and cochlear coordinates could provide potentially useful spectral transforms of speech and other acoustic signals. In 1961, an almost-exponential function was developed (Greenwood, 1961b, 1974) by integrating an exponential function fitted to a subset of frequency resolution-integration estimates (critical bandwidths). The resulting frequency-position function was found to fit cochlear observations on human cadaver ears quite well and, with changes of constants, those on elephant, cow, guinea pig, rat, mouse, and chicken (B{\'e}k{\'e}sy, 1960), as well as in vivo (behavioral-anatomical) data on cats (Schucknecht, 1953). Since 1961, new mechanical and other physiological data have appeared on the human, cat, guinea pig, chinchilla, monkey, and gerbil. It is shown here that the newer extended data on human cadaver ears and from living animal preparations are quite well fit by the same basic function. The function essentially requires only empirical adjustment of a single parameter to set an upper frequency limit, while a "slope" parameter can be left constant if cochlear partition length is normalized to 1 or scaled if distance is specified in physical units. Constancy of slope and form in dead and living ears and across species increases the probability that the function fitting human cadaver data may apply as well to the living human ear. This prospect increases the function's value in plotting auditory data and in modeling concerned with speech and other bioacoustic signals, since it fits the available physiological data well and, consequently (if those data are correct), remains independent of, and an appropriate means to examine, psychoacoustic data and assumptions.},

abstract = {Visual cortical areas are activated by auditory stimuli in blind mice. Direct heteromodal cortical connections have been shown between the primary auditory cortex (A1) and primary visual cortex (V1), and between A1 and secondary visual cortex (V2). Auditory afferents to V2 terminate in close proximity to neurons that project to V1, and potentially constitute an effective indirect pathway between A1 and V1. In this study, we injected a retrograde adenoviral vector that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein under a synapsin promotor in V1 and biotinylated dextran amine as an anterograde tracer in A1 to determine: (i) whether A1 axon terminals establish synaptic contacts onto the lateral part of V2 (V2L) neurons that project to V1; and (ii) if this indirect cortical pathway is altered by a neonatal enucleation in mice. Complete dendritic arbors of layer V pyramidal neurons were reconstructed in 3D, and putative contacts between pre-synaptic auditory inputs and postsynaptic visual neurons were analysed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Putative synaptic contacts were classified as high-confidence and low-confidence contacts, and charted onto dendritic trees. As all reconstructed layer V pyramidal neurons received auditory inputs by these criteria, we conclude that V2L acts as an important relay between A1 and V1. Auditory inputs are preferentially located onto lower branch order dendrites in enucleated mice. Also, V2L neurons are subject to morphological reorganizations in both apical and basal dendrites after the loss of vision. The A1-V2L-V1 pathway could be involved in multisensory processing and contribute to the auditory activation of the occipital cortex in the blind rodent.},

abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that infants' thresholds for a pure tone are elevated by a masker more than would be predicted from their critical bandwidths. The present studies explored the nature of this additional masking. In Experiment 1, detection thresholds of 6-month-old infants and of adults for a 1-kHz tone were estimated under three conditions: in quiet, in the presence of a 4- to 10-kHz bandpass noise at 40 dB SPL, and in the presence of the same noise at 50 dB SPL. The noise was gated on at the beginning of each trial. Adult thresholds were the same in all three conditions, indicating that little or no sensory masking took place in the presence of the noise. Infant thresholds were about 10 dB higher in the presence of the noise. We term this effect distraction masking. In Experiment 2, the effect of gating the noise on at trial onset was examined. Thresholds for the same tone were estimated in quiet and in the presence of the band-pass noise at 40 dB SPL, but the noise was presented continuously during the session. Under these conditions, distraction masking was still observed for infants. These findings suggest that a masker can have nonsensory effects on infants' performance in a psychoacoustic task.},

abstract = {Steady-state evoked potentials can be recorded from the human scalp in response to auditory stimuli presented at rates between 1 and 200 Hz or by periodic modulations of the amplitude and/or frequency of a continuous tone. Responses can be objectively detected using frequency-based analyses. In waking subjects, the responses are particularly prominent at rates near 40 Hz. Responses evoked by more rapidly presented stimuli are less affected by changes in arousal and can be evoked by multiple simultaneous stimuli without significant loss of amplitude. Response amplitude increases as the depth of modulation or the intensity increases. The phase delay of the response increases as the intensity or the carrier frequency decreases. Auditory steady-state responses are generated throughout the auditory nervous system, with cortical regions contributing more than brainstem generators to responses at lower modulation frequencies. These responses are useful for objectively evaluating auditory thresholds, assessing suprathreshold hearing, and monitoring the state of arousal during anesthesia.},

abstract = {Biologically relevant sounds such as speech, animal vocalizations and music have distinguishing temporal features that are utilized for effective auditory perception. Common temporal features include sound envelope fluctuations, often modeled in the laboratory by amplitude modulation (AM), and starts and stops in ongoing sounds, which are frequently approximated by hearing researchers as gaps between two sounds or are investigated in forward masking experiments. The auditory system has evolved many neural processing mechanisms for encoding important temporal features of sound. Due to rapid progress made in the field of auditory neuroscience in the past three decades, it is not possible to review all progress in this field in a single article. The goal of the present report is to focus on single-unit mechanisms in the mammalian brainstem auditory system for encoding AM and gaps as illustrative examples of how the system encodes key temporal features of sound. This report, following a systems analysis approach, starts with findings in the auditory nerve and proceeds centrally through the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex and inferior colliculus. Some general principles can be seen when reviewing this entire field. For example, as one ascends the central auditory system, a neural encoding shift occurs. An emphasis on synchronous responses for temporal coding exists in the auditory periphery, and more reliance on rate coding occurs as one moves centrally. In addition, for AM, modulation transfer functions become more bandpass as the sound level of the signal is raised, but become more lowpass in shape as background noise is added. In many cases, AM coding can actually increase in the presence of background noise. For gap processing or forward masking, coding for gaps changes from a decrease in spike firing rate for neurons of the peripheral auditory system that have sustained response patterns, to an increase in firing rate for more central neurons with transient responses. Lastly, for gaps and forward masking, as one ascends the auditory system, some suppression effects become quite long (echo suppression), and in some stimulus configurations enhancement to a second sound can take place.},

abstract = {It is well known that medial olivocochlear system (MOC) activity causes inhibition of cochlear amplification that can be measured using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). The temporal characteristics of this MOC inhibitory effect are still not well understood. Two experiments were performed to further explore a previously reported enhancement in MOC inhibition of OAEs by a broadband noise (BBN) elicitor modulated at 100Hz (AM-BBN). In experiment I, MOC inhibition was measured for toneburst (1 and 2kHz presented at 41.67Hz) and stimulus-frequency (0.96-1.92kHz) OAEs for two elicitor conditions, BBN and AM-BBN (100% modulation depth [MD]), in 27 young normal hearing adults. In experiment II, tonebursts were presented at 50Hz instead of 41.67Hz to test if the previously reported enhancement of the MOC response to 100Hz AM-BBN is specific to a 50Hz toneburst presentation rate. All elicitors caused significant reduction of both TB- and SF-OAE amplitude. AM-BBN evoked the same OAE inhibition compared to BBN in both experiments. This pattern was consistent across OAE types, and toneburst presentation rates. Results suggest that the MOC is not especially sensitive to 100Hz AM-BBN; instead, AM dips in noise energy likely reduce its effectiveness in evoking MOC activity due to temporal energy integration.},

DESIGN:Cross-sectional study.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:Seventy-nine newborns at low risk for hearing loss and 46 at high risk underwent transient evoked OAE (TEOAE), distortion product OAE (DPOAE) and ABR testing with or without the presence of contralateral white noise presented at a level of 60 dB SPL.

RESULTS:For both low- and high-risk newborns, there were no significant differences in IE between the left and right ears. There was a statistically significant difference in the right-ear IE between the low- and high-risk group for DPOAE and ABR testing. There was also greater agreement of the efferent system evaluation outcomes between TEOAE and ABR.

CONCLUSIONS:ABR testing detected IE in a greater number of newborns in the low-risk, as compared to the high-risk group.},

abstract = {This paper describes low-frequency auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) to speech-weighted noise stimuli. The effect of modulation frequency was evaluated within the frequency range below 40 Hz. Furthermore, objective ASSR measures were related to speech understanding performance in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. The variability in ASSR recordings over independent test sessions was larger between subjects than within. Trends of increased responses around 10 and/or 20 Hz were found in all subjects. Obtained latency estimates of the responses pointed to primarily cortical sources involved in ASSR generation at low frequencies. Furthermore, significant differences between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults were found for ASSRs to stimuli related to the temporal envelope of speech. Comparing these responses with phoneme identification scores over different stimulus levels showed both measures increased with stimulus level in a similar way (rho=0.82). At a fixed stimulus level, ASSRs were significantly correlated with speech reception thresholds for phonemes and sentences in noise (rho from -0.45 to -0.53). These results indicate that objective low-frequency ASSRs are related to behavioral speech understanding, independently of level.},

abstract = {This article considers the efficiency of evoked potential audiometry using steady-state responses evoked by multiple simultaneous stimuli with carrier frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The general principles of signal-to-noise enhancement through averaging provide a basis for determining the time required to estimate thresholds. The advantage of the multiple-stimulus technique over a single-stimulus approach is less than the ratio of the number of stimuli presented. When testing two ears simultaneously, the advantage is typically that the multiple-stimulus technique is two to three times faster. One factor that increases the time of the multiple-response recording is the relatively small size of responses at 500 and 4000 Hz. Increasing the intensities of the 500- and 4000-Hz stimuli by 10 or 20 dB can enhance their responses without significantly changing the other responses. Using multiple simultaneous stimuli causes small changes in the responses compared with when the responses are evoked by single stimuli. The clearest of these interactions is the attenuation of the responses to low-frequency stimuli in the presence of higher-frequency stimuli. Although these interactions are interesting physiologically, their small size means that they do not lessen the advantages of the multiple-stimulus approach.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:To establish the age at which children can complete tests of spatial listening and to measure the normative relationship between age and performance.

METHOD:Fifty-six normal-hearing children, ages 1.5-7.9 years, attempted tests of the ability to discriminate a sound source on the left from one on the right, to localize a source, to track moving sources, and to perceive speech in noise.

RESULTS:Tests of left-right discrimination, movement tracking, and speech perception were completed by $\ge$ 75% of children older than 3 years. Children showed adult levels of performance from age 1.5 years (movement tracking), 3 years (left-right discrimination), and 6 years (localization and speech in noise). Spatial release from masking-calculated as the difference in speech reception thresholds between conditions with spatially coincident and spatially separate sp-eech and noise--remained constant at 5 dB from age 3 years. Data from a separate study demonstrate the age at which children with cochlear implants can complete the same tests. Assessments of left-right discrimination, movement tracking, and speech perception were completed by $\ge$ 75% of children who are older than 5 years and who wear cochlear implants.

CONCLUSION:These data can guide the selection of tests for future studies and inform the interpretation of results from clinical populations.},

Experimental evidence for or against the positive feedback hypothesis is still lacking. Here we apply linear control theory to determine the open-loop gain and the closed-loop sensitivity of the cochlear amplifier from available measurements of basilar membrane vibration in sensitive mammalian cochleae. We show that the frequency of peak closed-loop sensitivity is independent of the stimulus level and close to the characteristic frequency. This implies that the half-octave shift in mammalian hearing is an epiphenomenon of the cochlear amplifier. The open-loop gain is consistent with positive feedback and suggests that the high-frequency cut-off of the outer hair cell transmembrane potential in vivo may be necessary for cochlear amplification.},

abstract = {Alpha-band oscillations are the dominant oscillations in the human brain and recent evidence suggests that they have an inhibitory function. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that alpha-band oscillations also play an active role in information processing. In this article, I suggest that alpha-band oscillations have two roles (inhibition and timing) that are closely linked to two fundamental functions of attention (suppression and selection), which enable controlled knowledge access and semantic orientation (the ability to be consciously oriented in time, space, and context). As such, alpha-band oscillations reflect one of the most basic cognitive processes and can also be shown to play a key role in the coalescence of brain activity in different frequencies.},

DESIGN:Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and their suppression by the efferent activity of the medial olivocochlear system (MOCS) in response to contralateral acoustic stimulation were used to compare these processes in 18 children with SLI and 21 controls.

RESULTS:The results revealed no group difference in TEOAE suppression effect or left/right asymmetry of TEOAE suppression effect.

CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest that children with SLI do not have auditory processing problems at this peripheral level casting doubt on a hypothesized relationship between strength of MOCS activity and language impairment.},

abstract = {In order to explore the origin of acoustic distortion product (DP) in the ear canal, the effect of the level and the frequency of the suppressor tone on the level of the DP was investigated. The results broadly support previous studies in showing that, with increasing suppressor level, the DP level shows an initial relatively stable plateau or gradual decline, followed by a rapid decline. The shape of the human iso-suppression contours derived from these "suppression-rate" curves was found to depend upon the size of the iso-suppression criterion. Low-level suppressor tones close in frequency to 2f1-f2 were effective at suppressing the DP by up to 3 dB in subjects where the distortion frequency fell at a region of strong stimulus frequency re-emission. It is probable that contributions from the DP frequency region, as well as components from the primary frequency region, make up the ear canal measured DP. With a 6-dB iso-suppression criterion, suppressor tones in the primary frequency region suppress DP most effectively.},

Responses to all questions tend to be positively correlated, and the whole questionnaire correlates with other recent measures of self-reported deficit in memory, absent-mindedness, or slips of action. The questionnaire is however only weakly correlated with indices of social desirability set or of neuroticism. It is significantly correlated with ratings of the respondent by his or her spouse, and accordingly does have some external significance rather than purely private opinion of the self. The score is reasonably stable over long periods, to about the same extent as traditional measures of trait rather than state. Furthermore, it has not thus far been found to change in persons exposed to life-stresses. However, it does frequently correlate with the number of current psychiatric symptoms reported by the same person on the MHQ; and in one study it has been found that CFQ predicts subsequent MHQ in persons who work at a stressful job in the interval. It does not do so in those who work in a less stressful environment. The most plausible view is that cognitive failure makes a person vulnerable to showing bad effects of stress, rather than itself resulting from stress.},

abstract = {Behavioral manifestations of processing deficits associated with auditory processing disorder (APD) have been well documented. However, little is known about their anatomical underpinnings, especially cochlear processing. Cochlear delays, a proxy for cochlear tuning, measured using stimulus frequency otoacoustic emission (SFOAE) group delay, and the influence of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system activation at the auditory periphery was studied in 23 children suspected with APD (sAPD) and 22 typically developing (TD) children. Results suggest that children suspected with APD have longer SFOAE group delays (possibly due to sharper cochlear tuning) and reduced MOC function compared to TD children. Other differences between the groups include correlation between MOC function and SFOAE delay in quiet in the TD group, and lack thereof in the sAPD group. MOC-mediated changes in SFOAE delay were in opposite directions between groups: increase in delay in TD vs. reduction in delay in the sAPD group. Longer SFOAE group delays in the sAPD group may lead to longer cochlear filter ringing, and potential increase in forward masking. These results indicate differences in cochlear and MOC function between sAPD and TD groups. Further studies are warranted to explore the possibility of cochlea as a potential site for processing deficits in APD.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to investigate the early maturation of the brainstem regulation of the cochlear function in preterm neonates. Evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAE) and their regulation via the medial olivocochlear efferent (MOC) reflex were investigated in a large population of preterm neonates and compared with full-term neonates and young babies from birth to 4 y and school-aged children. In 28-wk preterm neonates, EOAE were seen in the mid-frequency range. These responses extended both to the low (down to 1025 Hz) and high (up to 6152 Hz) frequency ranges at 38 wk of gestational age and remained stable up to 4 mo. At this stage, the amplitude of EOAE overlapped adult values. EOAE amplitudes then decreased to reach adult values at 3 y of age. Maturation of MOC efferents innervating the outer hair cells was investigated by studying the suppressive effect of contralateral sound on the EOAE amplitudes (MOC reflex). The first MOC responses were recorded in preterm neonates of 32-33 wk of gestational age, reaching adult-like values at 37 wk of gestational age. The maximum effect of MOC efferent activation occurred between 2000 and 4000 Hz. These results suggest that, in humans, MOC efferents mature in utero. Thus, testing the MOC reflex may have a clinical relevance to detect an abnormal development of the auditory pathways, particularly of a brainstem circuitry not explored through conventional testing.},

abstract = {When normal-hearing adults and children are required to detect a 1000-Hz tone in a random-frequency multitone masker, masking is often observed in excess of that predicted by traditional auditory filter models. The excess masking is called informational masking. Though individual differences in the effect are large, the amount of informational masking is typically much greater in young children than in adults [Oh et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 109, 2888{\textendash}2895 (2001)]. One factor that reduces informational masking in adults is spatial separation of the target tone and masker. The present study was undertaken to determine whether or not a similar effect of spatial separation is observed in children. An extreme case of spatial separation was used in which the target tone was presented to one ear and the random multitone masker to the other ear. This condition resulted in nearly complete elimination of masking in adults. In young children, however, presenting the masker to the nontarget ear typically produced only a slight decrease in overall masking and no change in informational masking. The results for children are interpreted in terms of a model that gives equal weight to the auditory filter outputs from each ear.},

abstract = {The medial olivocochlear (MOC) system, which originates in the brainstem and projects to the outer hair cells in the cochlea, is thought to be involved in improving signal detection in noisy backgrounds. This proposition arises from the observation that the input-output functions of auditory primary afferent fibres to pure tones recorded in a continuous background noise are unmasked by MOC activation, improving the dynamic range, and is supported by both animal and human behavioural experiments. However, it is not known how the unmasking effects observed in the cochlea are translated into higher auditory brain centres, such as the cochlear nucleus, where intrinsic circuitry can potentially modulate any effect. In this study we have investigated the effects of continuous background noise without and with MOC system activation, on responses of different neuron types in the ventral cochlear nucleus of the guinea pig. Results show that the unmasking effects of MOC system activation on tone responses in continuous background noise are present in the cochlear nucleus. These unmasking effects manifest themselves as decompression of input-output functions as well as an improved slope, which results in an improvement in intensity discrimination of the tones. The data show, however, that the strength of the unmasking effects of MOC system activation varies between the different neuronal types. Unmasking was not detected in onset chopper neurons despite its demonstrable presence in other neuronal types in the same animals. These observations may reflect the level of involvement of different neuronal types in intensity discrimination.},

abstract = {The brain selectively extracts the most relevant information in top-down processing manner. Does the corticofugal system, a "back projection system," constitute the neural basis of such top-down selection? Here, we show how focal activation of the auditory cortex with 500 nA electrical pulses influences the auditory information processing in the cochlear nucleus (CN) that receives almost unprocessed information directly from the ear. We found that cortical activation increased the response magnitudes and shortened response latencies of physiologically matched CN neurons, whereas decreased response magnitudes and lengthened response latencies of unmatched CN neurons. In addition, cortical activation shifted the frequency tunings of unmatched CN neurons toward those of the activated cortical neurons. Our data suggest that cortical activation selectively enhances the neural processing of particular auditory information and attenuates others at the first processing level in the brain based on sound frequencies encoded in the auditory cortex. The auditory cortex apparently implements a long-range feedback mechanism to select or filter incoming signals from the ear.},

abstract = {Two types of sensory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea signal through anatomically distinct populations of spiral ganglion afferent neurons. The solitary inner hair cell ribbon synapse uses multivesicular release to trigger action potentials that encode acoustic timing, intensity, and frequency in each type I afferent. In contrast, cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) have a far weaker effect on their postsynaptic targets, the type II spiral ganglion afferents. OHCs typically release single vesicles with low probability so that extensive summation is required to reach the relatively high action potential initiation threshold. These stark differences in synaptic transfer call into question whether type II neurons contribute to the cognitive perception of sound. Given the sparse and weak synaptic inputs from OHCs, the electrical properties of type II afferents are crucial in determining whether synaptic responses can sum to evoke an action potential to convey information to the cochlear nucleus. In the present work, dual-electrode recordings determined that type II afferents of rats have length constants that exceed the length of the distal, spiral process, enabling spatial summation from widespread OHCs. Focal application of tetrodotoxin localized the spike initiation zone to the type II proximal, radial process, near the spiral ganglion, in agreement with the high voltage threshold measured in the spiral process. These measured membrane properties were incorporated into a compartmental model of the type II neuron to demonstrate that neurotransmitter release from at least six OHCs is required to trigger an action potential in a type II neuron.},

abstract = {The old concept stating that EEG alpha (10-Hz) activity reflects passive or idling states of the brain is giving way to modern views of 10-Hz oscillations in relation to diverse brain functions comprising sensory, motor, and memory processes: (1) Spontaneous alpha activity is not pure noise as shown by methods of chaos analysis. (2) Evoked alpha oscillations patterns (precisely time-locked to a stimulus; duration approx. 200-300 ms) depend on the modality of stimulation and the recording site. (3) Induced alpha oscillations are initiated by, but not closely time-locked to a stimulus. (4) 10-Hz oscillations are recorded in nervous systems of different complexities, from the human brain to isolated ganglia of invertebrates. The neural origins of 10-Hz oscillations are demonstrated by recordings at the cellular level. (5) Rather than trying to locate a unique alpha generator, it is preferable to assume that a 'diffuse and distributed alpha system' exists. A particular support for this hypothesis is given by stimulus-dependent hippocampal alpha responses in the cat brain. (6) The major physiological meaning of 10-Hz oscillations may be comparable to the putative universal role of gamma responses in brain signaling.},

abstract = {Under certain conditions, detection of a masked tone is improved by a preceding sound ("precursor"). This phenomenon is referred to as the "temporal effect" or "overshoot". A prevalent model of overshoot, referred to as the "gain reduction model", posits that overshoot is caused by efferent reduction in cochlear gain mediated by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) bundle. The model predicts that reduction in cochlear gain will reduce masking when masking is suppressive or when masking is excitatory and the signal-to-masker ratio is high. This study was aimed at testing the validity of these predictions. It consisted of two experiments. The first experiment investigated the relative contributions of suppressive versus excitatory masking to overshoot. The signal was a short 4-kHz tone pip, and the masker and precursor were limited to contain energy either only within (-on-frequency) or only outside (off-frequency) the cochlear filter around the signal frequency. The on-frequency masker would be expected to cause mainly excitatory masking, whereas masking by the off-frequency masker would be expected to be mainly suppressive. Only the off-frequency masker and precursor yielded -significant overshoot. This suggests that measurable overshoot requires suppressive masking. The second experiment sought to quantify the effect of a precursor on cochlear -suppression more directly by measuring the amount of suppression caused by a 4.75-kHz suppressor on a lower-frequency (4-kHz) suppressee with and without a precursor present. Suppression was measured using a forward-masking paradigm. While we found large suppression and large overshoot, we found no reduction in suppression by the precursor. This is contrary to the gain reduction model. Taken together, our results indicate that measurable overshoot requires off-frequency masking and that off-frequency overshoot must be caused by a mechanism other than MOC-mediated reduction in cochlear suppression.},

abstract = {The activity of the medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB) can be studied in humans through variations in the level of evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs) elicited by contralateral acoustic stimuli (CAS). The present study sought to investigate how the activity of the MOC system at a given frequency, as measured through the contralateral suppression of tone-pip EOAEs, depends on the bandwidth of the contralateral stimulus. EOAEs were recorded in 155 normal-hearing subjects, successively with and without contralateral stimuli whose bandwidth, center frequency and level were systematically varied. We showed a clear dependence of contralateral EOAE suppression on bandwidth demonstrating increased suppression with increased bandwidth over about two octaves around the center frequency of the noise. This effect was obtained irrespective of whether contralateral noise energy was kept constant independently of bandwidth or not, which indicates a role of bandwidth per se in contralateral EOAE suppression. Results are interpreted in terms of a simple model of MOCB activation mechanisms including peripheral bandpass filtering, within-channel compression and across-channel spatial summation by the afferent paths. Complementary experiments suggested a greater effectiveness of increases in bandwidth on the upper than on the lower side and of frequency components akin to or remote from the test frequency than of intermediate bands. Finally, these results were complemented by detailed spectrum analyses of the EOAE level variations induced by the different noises, which revealed that whilst noise components close to or remote from the center frequency generally attenuated EOAE level, intermediate components could in some cases lead to a relative increase in EOAE level. These results can further be explained by assuming different positive and negative weights on the inputs to the spatial summation process depending on their position relative to the center frequency.},

abstract = {A new auditory phenomenon has been identified in the acoustic impulse response of the human ear. Using a signal averaging technique, a study has been made of the response of the closed external acoustic meatus to acoustic impulses near to the threshold of audibility. Particular attention has been paid to the waveform of the response at post excitation times in excess of 5 ms. No previous worker appears to have extended observations into this region. The response observed after about 5 ms is not a simple extension of the initial response attributable to the middle ear. The oscillatory response decay time constant was found to change from approximately 1 ms to over 12 ms at about this time. The slowly decaying response component was present in all normal ears tested, but was not present in ears with cochlear deafness. This component of the response appears to have its origin in some nonlinear mechanism probably located in the cochlea, responding mechanically to auditory stimulation, and dependent upon the normal functioning of the cochlea transduction process. A cochlear reflection hypothesis received some support from these results.},

In the absence of peripheral hearing loss, these speech perception difficulties may arise from dysfunction at more central levels in the auditory system, including subcortical structures. We examined brainstem encoding of pitch in a speech syllable in 38 school-age children. In children with poor speech-in-noise perception, we find impaired encoding of the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic, two important cues for pitch perception. Pitch, an essential factor in speaker identification, aids the listener in tracking a specific voice from a background of voices. These results suggest that the robustness of subcortical neural encoding of pitch features in time-varying signals is a key factor in determining success with perceiving speech in noise.},

abstract = {This study assessed the acoustic and perceptual effect of noise on vowel and stop-consonant spectra. Multi-talker babble and speech-shaped noise were added to vowel and stop stimuli at -5 to +10 dB S/N, and the effect of noise was quantified in terms of (a) spectral envelope differences between the noisy and clean spectra in three frequency bands, (b) presence of reliable F1 and F2 information in noise, and (c) changes in burst frequency and slope. Acoustic analysis indicated that F1 was detected more reliably than F2 and the largest spectral envelope differences between the noisy and clean vowel spectra occurred in the mid-frequency band. This finding suggests that in extremely noisy conditions listeners must be relying on relatively accurate F1 frequency information along with partial F2 information to identify vowels. Stop consonant recognition remained high even at -5 dB despite the disruption of burst cues due to additive noise, suggesting that listeners must be relying on other cues, perhaps formant transitions, to identify stops.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In spite of extensive research conducted to study how human brain works, little is known about a special function of the brain that stores and manipulates information-the working memory-and how noise influences this special ability. In this study, Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate brain responses to arithmetic problems solved in noisy and quiet backgrounds.

METHODS:Eighteen healthy young males performed simple arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction with in-quiet and in-noise backgrounds. The MATLAB-based Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) was implemented on the fMRI datasets to generate and analyse the activated brain regions.

RESULTS:Group results showed that addition and subtraction operations evoked extended activation in the left inferior parietal lobe, left precentral gyrus, left superior parietal lobe, left supramarginal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus. This supported the hypothesis that the human brain relatively activates its left hemisphere more compared with the right hemisphere when solving arithmetic problems. The insula, middle cingulate cortex, and middle frontal gyrus, however, showed more extended right hemispheric activation, potentially due to the involvement of attention, executive processes, and working memory. For addition operations, there was extensive left hemispheric activation in the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and thalamus. In contrast, subtraction tasks evoked a greater activation of similar brain structures in the right hemisphere. For both addition and subtraction operations, the total number of activated voxels was higher for in-noise than in-quiet conditions.

CONCLUSION:These findings suggest that when arithmetic operations were delivered auditorily, the auditory, attention, and working memory functions were required to accomplish the executive processing of the mathematical calculation. The respective brain activation patterns appear to be modulated by the noisy background condition.},

In this study of normal children and children with learning problems, impaired behavioral discrimination of a rapid speech change (/dalpha/versus/galpha/) was correlated with diminished magnitude of an electrophysiologic measure that is not dependent on attention or a voluntary response. The ability of children with learning problems to discriminate another rapid speech change (/balpha/versus/walpha/) also was reflected in the neurophysiology. These results indicate that some children's discrimination deficits originate in the auditory pathway before conscious perception and have implications for differential diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies for children with learning disabilities and attention disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: Otoacoustic emissions-based efferent assays are evolving to become a part of auditory diagnostics. The wide range of clinical applications, such as assessment of auditory neuropathy, auditory processing disorders, learning disability, monitoring success in auditory intervention and others illustrate the significance of this measurement. Defining the procedure's test-retest repeatability is of critical importance, to allow for distinction between measurement deviations and true physiological or pathological changes. The purpose of this study was to assess the repeatability of a click-evoked otoacoustic emission-based (CEOAE) test of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex in normal-hearing (NH) adults. DESIGN:: Test-retest data were collected from 35 NH young adults in two distinct test sessions separated by 1 to 4 days. CEOAEs were recorded without and with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS; 35 dB SL). Three indices of the MOC reflex were computed: CAS-induced (a) absolute changes in CEOAE amplitude, (b) normalized changes in CEOAE amplitude, and (c) changes in CEOAE input-output functions. Repeatability of these indices was assessed by a three-layered approach, which consisted of Bland-Altman plots, coefficient of reliability (Cronbach's $\alpha$), and analysis of variance. RESULTS:: Analyses indicated good repeatability of three CEOAE-based MOC reflex indices. A two-way analysis of variance of the indices demonstrated no significant difference between test and retest. Normalized index showed similar repeatability as other indices. CEOAE signal to noise ratio did not seem to vary between test sessions. Notably, CAS caused a decrease in CEOAE input-output functions slope in a majority of participants (n = 29). CONCLUSIONS:: The present study is the first to elucidate the intrasubject variability of absolute and normalized indices of the MOC inhibitory effect. Although the measurements were conducted under realistic conditions resembling the clinical setting, repeatability was generally good in NH adults. For MOC reflex test, the signal to noise ratio of 6 dB for recording CEOAEs seems to be a recommendable criterion when considering practicability and measurement quality in clinical conditions. The present findings exemplify the suitability of CEOAE-based MOC assay as a monitoring tool of medial efferent status over time. The data are intended to assist clinicians and scientists alike in the accurate interpretation of CAS-induced CEOAE changes in the test-retest situation.},

abstract = {Preschoolers and adults were asked to detect a 1000-Hz signal, which was masked by a multitone complex. The frequencies and amplitudes of the components in the complex varied randomly and independently on each presentation. A staircase, cued two-interval, forced-choice procedure disguised as a "listening game" was used to obtain signal thresholds in quiet and in the presence of the multitone maskers. The number of components in the masker was fixed within an experimental condition and varied from 2 to 906 across experimental conditions. Thresholds were also measured with a broadband noise masker. Eight preschool children and eight adults were tested. Although individual differences were large, among both adults and children, there was little difference between the groups in the mean amount of masking produced by the maskers with large numbers of components (400 and 906). There was also a small but significant difference between adults and children in the mean amount of masking produced by the broadband noise. The difference between the groups was much larger with smaller numbers of components. Data obtained from the adults were basically similar to that previously reported [cf. Neff and Green, Percept. Psychophys. 41, 409-415 (1987); Oh and Lutfi, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 104, 3489-3499 (1998)]: maskers comprised of 10-40 components produced as much as 30 to 60 dB of masking in some, but not all listeners. Those same maskers produced larger amounts of masking (70-83 dB) in many of the preschool children, although, as in the adult group, individual differences were large. The component-relative-entropy (CoRE) model [Lutfi, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 94, 748-758 (1993)] was used to describe the differences in performance between the children and adults. According to this model the average child appears to integrate information over a larger number of auditory filters than the average adult.},

abstract = {Detailed analysis of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) in human subjects revealed that all stable SOAEs sufficiently above the noise floor to permit appropriate analysis have sidebands at multiples of approximately 1 Hz. This is consistent with the hypothesis that SOAEs are modulated by heartbeat. Simultaneous measurement of the rate of blood flow to the thumb and the separation of the spectral sidebands demonstrated that they covary (r = 0.982, p < 5 x 10(-10)). An adaptive least-squares fit (LSF) paradigm was developed to facilitate the measurement of the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the signals. A combination of traditional spectral analyses and new LSF analyses showed that the sideband generation stems from frequency modulation of the emissions. If there is any amplitude modulation correlated with the blood flow, it is below the noise floor of the analysis. The frequency of the emission was at a minimum when the blood flow was maximal. Examination of alternative mechanisms using computer simulations suggests that these changes stem from changes of 10-100 ppm in the mass of the basilar membrane.},

abstract = {The present work reviews theories and empirical findings, including results from two new experiments, that bear on the perception of English vowels, with an emphasis on the comparison of data analytic "machine recognition" approaches with results from speech perception experiments. Two major sources of variability (viz., speaker differences and consonantal context effects) are addressed from the classical perspective of overlap between vowel categories in F1 x F2 space. Various approaches to the reduction of this overlap are evaluated. Two types of speaker normalization are considered. "Intrinsic" methods based on relationships among the steady-state properties (F0, F1, F2, and F3) within individual vowel tokens are contrasted with "extrinsic" methods, involving the relationships among the formant frequencies of the entire vowel system of a single speaker. Evidence from a new experiment supports Ainsworth's (1975) conclusion [W. Ainsworth, Auditory Analysis and Perception of Speech (Academic, London, 1975)] that both types of information have a role to play in perception. The effects of consonantal context on formant overlap are also considered. A new experiment is presented that extends Lindblom and Studdert-Kennedy's finding [B. Lindblom and M. Studdert-Kennedy, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 43, 840-843 (1967)] of perceptual effects of consonantal context on vowel perception to /dVd/ and /bVb/ contexts. Finally, the role of vowel-inherent dynamic properties, including duration and diphthongization, is briefly reviewed. All of the above factors are shown to have reliable influences on vowel perception, although the relative weight of such effects and the circumstances that alter these weights remain far from clear.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:In natural hearing, cochlear mechanical compression is dynamically adjusted via the efferent medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR). These adjustments probably help understanding speech in noisy environments and are not available to the users of current cochlear implants (CIs). The aims of the present study are to: (1) present a binaural CI sound processing strategy inspired by the control of cochlear compression provided by the contralateral MOCR in natural hearing; and (2) assess the benefits of the new strategy for understanding speech presented in competition with steady noise with a speech-like spectrum in various spatial configurations of the speech and noise sources.

DESIGN:Pairs of CI sound processors (one per ear) were constructed to mimic or not mimic the effects of the contralateral MOCR on compression. For the nonmimicking condition (standard strategy or STD), the two processors in a pair functioned similarly to standard clinical processors (i.e., with fixed back-end compression and independently of each other). When configured to mimic the effects of the MOCR (MOC strategy), the two processors communicated with each other and the amount of back-end compression in a given frequency channel of each processor in the pair decreased/increased dynamically (so that output levels dropped/increased) with increases/decreases in the output energy from the corresponding frequency channel in the contralateral processor. Speech reception thresholds in speech-shaped noise were measured for 3 bilateral CI users and 2 single-sided deaf unilateral CI users. Thresholds were compared for the STD and MOC strategies in unilateral and bilateral listening conditions and for three spatial configurations of the speech and noise sources in simulated free-field conditions: speech and noise sources colocated in front of the listener, speech on the left ear with noise in front of the listener, and speech on the left ear with noise on the right ear. In both bilateral and unilateral listening, the electrical stimulus delivered to the test ear(s) was always calculated as if the listeners were wearing bilateral processors.

RESULTS:In both unilateral and bilateral listening conditions, mean speech reception thresholds were comparable with the two strategies for colocated speech and noise sources, but were at least 2 dB lower (better) with the MOC than with the STD strategy for spatially separated speech and noise sources. In unilateral listening conditions, mean thresholds improved with increasing the spatial separation between the speech and noise sources regardless of the strategy but the improvement was significantly greater with the MOC strategy. In bilateral listening conditions, thresholds improved significantly with increasing the speech-noise spatial separation only with the MOC strategy.

CONCLUSIONS:The MOC strategy (1) significantly improved the intelligibility of speech presented in competition with a spatially separated noise source, both in unilateral and bilateral listening conditions; (2) produced significant spatial release from masking in bilateral listening conditions, something that did not occur with fixed compression; and (3) enhanced spatial release from masking in unilateral listening conditions. The MOC strategy as implemented here, or a modified version of it, may be usefully applied in CIs and in hearing aids.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

abstract = {Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and their steady-state counterpart (subcortical steady-state responses, SSSRs) are generally thought to be insensitive to cognitive demands. However, a handful of studies report that SSSRs are modulated depending on the subject׳s focus of attention, either towards or away from an auditory stimulus. Here, we explored whether attentional focus affects the envelope-following response (EFR), which is a particular kind of SSSR, and if so, whether the effects are specific to which sound elements in a sound mixture a subject is attending (selective auditory attentional modulation), specific to attended sensory input (inter-modal attentional modulation), or insensitive to attentional focus. We compared the strength of EFR-stimulus phase locking in human listeners under various tasks: listening to a monaural stimulus, selectively attending to a particular ear during dichotic stimulus presentation, and attending to visual stimuli while ignoring dichotic auditory inputs. We observed no systematic changes in the EFR across experimental manipulations, even though cortical EEG revealed attention-related modulations of alpha activity during the task. We conclude that attentional effects, if any, on human subcortical representation of sounds cannot be observed robustly using EFRs.

abstract = {Listeners localized the free-field sources of either one or two simultaneous and independently generated noise bursts. Listeners' localization performance was better when localizing one rather than two sound sources. With two sound sources, localization performance was better when the listener was provided prior information about the location of one of them. Listeners also localized two simultaneous noise bursts that had sinusoidal amplitude modulation (AM) applied, in which the modulation envelope was in-phase across the two source locations or was 180{\textdegree} out-of-phase. The AM was employed to investigate a hypothesis as to what process listeners might use to localize multiple sound sources. The results supported the hypothesis that localization of two sound sources might be based on temporal-spectral regions of the combined waveform in which the sound from one source was more intense than that from the other source. The interaural information extracted from such temporal-spectral regions might provide reliable estimates of the sound source location that produced the more intense sound in that temporal-spectral region.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study were to determine (1) the contribution of low-frequency activity in the auditory brain stem response (ABR) to the binaural interaction component, and (2) an optimal set of parameters for recording the binaural interaction component. ABRs were recorded from 12 adult subjects with normal hearing using 1000 Hz tone pips at three stimulation rates (10, 25, and 50/sec) and two physiological filters (150-3000 and 30-3000 Hz). The latencies of wave V in the sum of the left and right monaural responses [V(L + R)] were shorter with the 150 to 3000 Hz filter than with the 30 to 3000 Hz filter, whereas the amplitudes of V(L + R) and peak A of the binaural interaction component were similar. The amplitudes of V(L + R) and A were larger for 50/sec than for 10 or 25/sec, but the amplitude ratio of peak A to wave V(L + R) was not different. In conclusion, (1) the activity between 30 to 150 Hz did not enhance the binaural interaction component, and (2) the largest and most reliable binaural interaction component was recorded with a rate of 50/sec and a filter setting of 150 to 3000 Hz.},

abstract = {The development of presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The auditory periphery exhibits a progressive bilateral, symmetrical reduction of auditory sensitivity to sound from high to low frequencies. The central auditory nervous system shows symptoms of decline in age-related cognitive abilities, including difficulties in speech discrimination and reduced central auditory processing, ultimately resulting in auditory perceptual abnormalities. The pathophysiological mechanisms of presbycusis include excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, aging and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage that results in apoptosis in the auditory pathway. However, the originating signals that trigger these mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, it is still unknown whether insulin is involved in auditory aging. Auditory aging has preclinical lesions, which manifest as asymptomatic loss of periphery auditory nerves and changes in the plasticity of the central auditory nervous system. Currently, the diagnosis of preclinical, reversible lesions depends on the detection of auditory impairment by functional imaging, and the identification of physiological and molecular biological markers. However, despite recent improvements in the application of these markers, they remain under-utilized in clinical practice. The application of antisenescent approaches to the prevention of auditory aging has produced inconsistent results. Future research will focus on the identification of markers for the diagnosis of preclinical auditory aging and the development of effective interventions.},

abstract = {Medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons provide an efferent innervation to outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea, but their tonotopic mapping is incompletely known. In the present study of anesthetized guinea pigs, the MOC mapping was investigated using in vivo, extracellular recording and labeling at a site along the cochlear course of the axons. The MOC axons enter the cochlea at its base and spiral apically, successively turning out to innervate OHCs according to their CFs. Recordings made at a site in the cochlear basal turn yielded a distribution of MOC CFs with an upper limit or "edge", due to usually absent higher-CF axons that presumably innervate more basal locations. The CFs at the edge, normalized across preparations, were equal to the CFs of the ANFs at the recording sites (near 16 kHz). Corresponding anatomical data from extracellular injections showed spiraling MOC axons giving rise to an edge of labeling at the position of a narrow band of labeled ANFs. Overall, the "edges" of the MOC CFs and labeling, with their correspondences to ANFs, suggest similar tonotopic mappings of these efferent and afferent fibers, at least in the cochlear basal turn. They also suggest that MOC axons miss much of the position of the more basally located cochlear amplifier appropriate for their CF; instead, the MOC innervation may be optimized for protection from damage by acoustic overstimulation.},

abstract = {1. Coincidence-detection of excitatory synaptic potentials has long been considered to be the mechanism by which medial superior olivary (MSO) neurons compute interaural time differences. Here we demonstrate the contribution of synaptic inhibition in this circuit using a gerbil brain slice preparation. 2. Nearly all cells exhibited excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and action potentials (APs) after stimulation of either the ipsilateral or contralateral afferent pathway. In 44% of cells, the latency of APs depended on stimulus amplitude, exhibiting shifts of 0.25-2 ms. 3. Nearly all neurons (89%) exhibited stimulus-evoked synaptic inhibition. The inhibitory effects were enhanced at greater stimulus amplitudes and were usually able to block synaptically evoked APs. In addition, APs and EPSPs were reversibly blocked by delivering the inhibitory transmitter glycine in almost all tested cells (91%). 4. In the presence of the glycine antagonist strychnine, the effects of synaptic inhibition were suppressed. 5. The stimulus level-dependent inhibitory potentials influenced the probability that an MSO neuron would fire an AP, as well as the precise timing. Therefore, the present results have implications for the processing of interaural time differences by the MSO and at higher auditory centers.},

abstract = {Efferent sensory systems have emerged as major components of processing by the central nervous system. Whereas the afferent sensory systems bring environmental information into the brain, efferent systems function to monitor, sharpen, and attend selectively to certain stimuli while ignoring others. This ability of the brain to implement these functions enables the organism to make fine discriminations and to respond appropriately to environmental conditions so that survival is enhanced. Our focus will be on auditory and vestibular efferents, topics linked together by the inner ear connection. The biological utility of the efferent system is striking. How it functions is less well understood, and with each new discovery, more questions arise. The book that is proposed here reflects our vision to share what is known on the topic by authors who actually have made the observations.},

abstract = {This article provides a review of recent developments in our understanding of how cochlear nonlinearity affects sound perception and how a loss of the nonlinearity associated with cochlear hearing impairment changes the way sounds are perceived. The response of the healthy mammalian basilar membrane (BM) to sound is sharply tuned, highly nonlinear, and compressive. Damage to the outer hair cells (OHCs) results in changes to all three attributes: in the case of total OHC loss, the response of the BM becomes broadly tuned and linear. Many of the differences in auditory perception and performance between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners can be explained in terms of these changes in BM response. Effects that can be accounted for in this way include poorer audiometric thresholds, loudness recruitment, reduced frequency selectivity, and changes in apparent temporal processing. All these effects can influence the ability of hearing-impaired listeners to perceive speech, especially in complex acoustic backgrounds. A number of behavioral methods have been proposed to estimate cochlear nonlinearity in individual listeners. By separating the effects of cochlear nonlinearity from other aspects of hearing impairment, such methods may contribute towards identifying the different physiological mechanisms responsible for hearing loss in individual patients. This in turn may lead to more accurate diagnoses and more effective hearing-aid fitting for individual patients. A remaining challenge is to devise a behavioral measure that is sufficiently accurate and efficient to be used in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Auditory processing disorder (APD) in children has been reported and discussed in the clinical and research literature for many years yet there remains poor agreement on diagnostic criteria, the relationship between APD and cognitive skills, and the importance of assessing underlying neural integrity.

PURPOSE:The present study used a repeated measures design to examine the relationship between a clinical APD diagnosis achieved with behavioral tests used in many clinics, cognitive abilities measured with standardized tests of intelligence, academic achievement, language, phonology, memory and attention and measures of auditory neural integrity as measured with acoustic reflex thresholds and auditory brainstem responses.

METHOD:Participants were 63 children, 7-17 years of age, who reported listening difficulties in spite of normal hearing thresholds. Parents/guardians completed surveys about the child's auditory and attention behavior while children completed an audiologic examination that included 5 behavioral tests of auditory processing ability. Standardized tests that examined intelligence, academic achievement, language, phonology, memory and attention, and objective tests auditory function included crossed and uncrossed acoustic reflex thresholds and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were also administered to each child.

RESULTS:Forty of the children received an APD diagnosis based on the 5 behavioral tests and 23 did not. The groups of children performed similarly on intelligence measures but the children with an APD diagnosis tended to perform more poorly on other cognitive measures. Auditory brainstem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds were often abnormal in both groups of children.

SUMMARY:Results of this study suggest that a purely behavioral test battery may be insufficient to accurately identify all children with auditory processing disorders. Physiologic test measures, including acoustic reflex and auditory brainstem response tests, are important indicators of auditory function and may be the only indication of a problem. The results also suggest that performance on behavioral APD tests may be strongly influenced by the child's language levels.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:This review covers topics relevant to olivocochlear-efferent anatomy and function for which there are new findings in papers from 2009 to early 2010.

RECENT FINDINGS:Work within the review period has increased our understanding of medial olivocochlear (MOC) mechanisms in outer hair cells, MOC-reflex tuning, MOC effects on distortion product otoacoustic emissions, the time course of MOC effects, MOC effects in psychophysical tests and on understanding speech, MOC effects in attention and learning, and lateral efferent function in binaural hearing. In addition, there are new insights into efferent molecular mechanisms and their effect on cochlear development.

SUMMARY:Techniques for measuring efferent effects using otoacoustic emissions are now well developed and have promise in clinical applications ranging from predicting which patients are susceptible to acoustic trauma to characterizing relationships between efferent activation and learning disabilities. To realize this promise, studies are needed in which these techniques are applied with high standards.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning has traditionally been portrayed as a bottom-up phenomenon that improves encoding or decoding of the trained stimulus. Cognitive skills such as attention and memory are thought to drive, guide and modulate learning but are, with notable exceptions, not generally considered to undergo changes themselves as a result of training with simple perceptual tasks. Moreover, shifts in threshold are interpreted as shifts in perceptual sensitivity, with no consideration for non-sensory factors (such as response bias) that may contribute to these changes. Accumulating evidence from our own research and others shows that perceptual learning is a conglomeration of effects, with training-induced changes ranging from the lowest (noise reduction in the phase locking of auditory signals) to the highest (working memory capacity) level of processing, and includes contributions from non-sensory factors that affect decision making even on a "simple" auditory task such as frequency discrimination. We discuss our emerging view of learning as a process that increases the signal-to-noise ratio associated with perceptual tasks by tackling noise sources and inefficiencies that cause performance bottlenecks, and present some implications for training populations other than young, smart, attentive and highly-motivated college students.},

abstract = {Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured using sinusoidal amplitude modulation (AM) tones. When one of the primary stimuli (f(1) or f(2), f(1) < f(2)) was amplitude modulated, a series of changes in the cubic difference tone (CDT) were observed. In the frequency domain, multiple sidebands were present around the CDT and their sizes grew with the modulation depth of the AM stimulus. In the time domain, the CDT showed different modulation patterns between two major signal conditions: the AM tone was used as the f(1) or the f(2). The CDT amplitude followed the AM tone when the f(1) was amplitude modulated. However, when the AM tone acted as the f(2), the CDT showed a more complex modulation pattern with a notch present at the AM tone peak. The relatively linear dependence of CDT on f(1) and the nonlinear relation with f(2) can be explained with a variable gain-control model representing hair cell functions at the DPOAE generation site. It is likely that processing of AM signals at a particular cochlear location depends on whether the hair cells are tuned to the frequency of the carrier. Nonlinear modulation is related to on-frequency carriers and off-frequency carriers are processed relatively linearly.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) as tools for identification of neonatal hearing impairment.

DESIGN:A total of 4911 infants including 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units, 353 well babies with one or more risk factors for hearing loss (Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 1994) and 80 well babies without risk factor who did not pass one or more neonatal test were targeted as the potential subject pool on which test performance would be assessed. During the neonatal period, they were evaluated using TEOAEs in response to an 80 dB pSPL click, DPOAE responses to two stimulus conditions (L1 = L2 = 75 dB SPL and L1 = 65 dB SPL L2 = 50 dB SPL), and ABR elicited by a 30 dB nHL click. In an effort to describe test performance, these "at-risk" infants were asked to return for behavioral audiologic assessments, using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) at 8 to 12 mo corrected age, regardless of neonatal test results. Sixty-four percent of these subjects returned and reliable VRA data were obtained on 95.6% of these returnees. This approach is in contrast to previous studies in which, by necessity, efforts were made to follow only those infants who "failed" the neonatal screening tests. The accuracy of the neonatal measures in predicting hearing status at 8 to 12 mo corrected age was determined. Only those infants who provided reliable, monaural VRA test results were included in the analysis. Separate analyses were performed without regard to intercurrent events (i.e., events between the neonatal and VRA tests that could cause their results to disagree), and then after accounting for the possible influence of intercurrent events such as otitis media and late-onset or progressive hearing loss.

RESULTS:Low refer rates were achieved for the stopping criteria used in the present study, especially when a protocol similar to the one recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference Report was followed. These analyses, however, do not completely describe test performance because they did not compare neonatal screening test results with a gold standard test of hearing. Test performance, as measured by the area under a relative operating characteristic curve, were similar for all three neonatal tests when neonatal test results were compared with VRA data obtained at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. However, ABRs were more successful at determining auditory status at 1 kHz, compared with the otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests. Performance was more similar across all three tests when they were used to identify hearing loss at 2 and 4 kHz. No test performed perfectly. Using either the two- or three-frequency pure-tone average (PTA), with a fixed false alarm rate of 20%, hit rates for the neonatal tests, in general, exceeded 80% when hearing impairment was defined as behavioral thresholds > or =30 dB HL. All three tests performed similarly when a two-frequency (2 and 4 kHz) PTA was used as the gold standard; OAE test performance decreased when a three-frequency PTA (adding 1 kHz) was used as the gold standard definition. For both PTA and all three neonatal screening measures, however, hit rate increased as the magnitude of hearing loss increased.

CONCLUSIONS:Singly, all three neonatal hearing screening tests resulted in low refer rates, especially if referrals for follow-up were made only for the cases in which stopping criteria were not met in both ears. Following a protocol similar to that recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference report resulted in refer rates that were less than 4%. TEOAEs at 80 dB pSPL, DPOAE at L1 = 65, L2 = 50 dB SPL and ABR at 30 dB nHL measured during the neonatal period, and as implemented in the current study, performed similarly at predicting behavioral hearing status at 8 to 12},

abstract = {The masking-level difference (MLD) was investigated in children aged 3.9 to 9.5 years and in an adult control group in order to examine the development of the MLD with age. A three-alternative forced-choice adaptive tracking procedure was used for all listeners. MLDs were determined for a 500-Hz pure-tone signal presented in a 300-Hz-wide masking noise centered on 500 Hz, where both interaural time and amplitude cues were present, and in 40-Hz-wide maskers centered on 500 Hz, where either amplitude (MLD delta a) or time (MLD delta t) cues were present. The masking noise level was fixed at 60 dB/Hz SPL. For the 300-Hz-wide masker, the MLDs of the children increased in magnitude up until the age of 5 or 6 years. For the 40-Hz-wide maskers, the MLDs of the 5- and 6-year-old children were still somewhat below adult values. It is possible that these differences between adults and children are related to the development of the peripheral/brainstem auditory system. By this interpretation, the MLD might be small in young listeners because the interaural time and amplitude cues underlying the MLD are coded with relatively poor precision. However, it is perhaps more likely that these differences are coded precisely in the peripheral auditory system, but that more central auditory processes are relatively inefficient in extracting the interaural information.},

abstract = {Stains for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and retrograde labeling with Fluorogold (FG) were used to study olivocochlear neurons and their dendritic patterns in mice. The two methods gave similar results for location and number of somata. The total number of medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) is about 170 per side. An additional dozen large olivocochlear neurons are located in the dorsal periolivary nucleus (DPO). Dendrites of all of these neurons are long and extend in all directions from the cell bodies, a pattern that contrasts with the sharp frequency tuning of their responses. For VNTB neurons, there were greater numbers of dendrites directed medially than laterally and those directed medially were longer (on average, 25-50% longer). Dendrite extensions were most pronounced for neurons located in the rostral portion of the VNTB. When each dendrite from a single neuron was represented as a vector, and all the vectors summed, the result was also skewed toward the medial direction. DPO neurons, however, had more symmetric dendrites that projected into more dorsal parts of the trapezoid body, suggesting that this small group of olivocochlear neurons has very different physiological properties. Dendrites of both types of neurons were somewhat elongated rostrally, about 20% longer than those directed caudally. These results can be interpreted as extensions of dendrites of olivocochlear neurons toward their synaptic inputs: medially to meet crossing fibers from the cochlear nucleus that are part of the MOC reflex pathway, and rostrally to meet descending inputs from higher centers.},

abstract = {The mammalian auditory system contains descending neural pathways, some of which project onto the cochlea via the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system. The function of this efferent auditory system is not entirely clear. Behavioral studies in animals with olivocochlear (OC) lesions suggest that the MOC serves to facilitate sound localization in noise. In the current work, noise-induced OC activity (the OC reflex) and sound-localization performance in noise were measured in normal-hearing humans. Consistent with earlier studies, both measures were found to vary substantially across individuals. Importantly, significant correlations were observed between OC-reflex strength and the effect of noise on sound-localization performance; the stronger the OC reflex, the less marked the effect of noise. These results suggest that MOC activation by noise helps to counteract the detrimental effects of background noise on neural representations of direction-dependent spectral features, which are especially important for accurate localization in the up/down and front/back dimensions.},

abstract = {Masked detection threshold for a short tone in noise improves as the tone's onset is delayed from the masker's onset. This improvement, known as "overshoot," is maximal at mid-masker levels and is reduced by temporary and permanent cochlear hearing loss. Computational modeling was used in the present study to evaluate proposed physiological mechanisms of overshoot, including classic firing rate adaptation and medial olivocochlear (MOC) feedback, for both normal hearing and cochlear hearing loss conditions. These theories were tested using an established model of the auditory periphery and signal detection theory techniques. The influence of several analysis variables on predicted tone-pip detection in broadband noise was evaluated, including: auditory nerve fiber spontaneous-rate (SR) pooling, range of characteristic frequencies, number of synapses per characteristic frequency, analysis window duration, and detection rule. The results revealed that overshoot similar to perceptual data in terms of both magnitude and level dependence could be predicted when the effects of MOC efferent feedback were included in the auditory nerve model. Conversely, simulations without MOC feedback effects never produced overshoot despite the model's ability to account for classic firing rate adaptation and dynamic range adaptation in auditory nerve responses. Cochlear hearing loss was predicted to reduce the size of overshoot only for model versions that included the effects of MOC efferent feedback. These findings suggest that overshoot in normal and hearing-impaired listeners is mediated by some form of dynamic range adaptation other than what is observed in the auditory nerve of anesthetized animals. Mechanisms for this adaptation may occur at several levels along the auditory pathway. Among these mechanisms, the MOC reflex may play a leading role.},

abstract = {The ability of listeners to detect level differences between two sinusoidal stimuli in a two-interval forced-choice procedure was measured as a function of duration and level in three conditions: (1) the pedestal was fixed in level and the stimuli in the two intervals had the same frequency of either 1 or 2 kHz (fixed-level condition); (2) the pedestal was roved in level over a 20-dB range from trial to trial, but the stimuli still had the same frequency of either 1 or 2 kHz (roving-level condition); and (3) the pedestal was roved in level over a 20-dB range and the two stimuli differed in frequency, such that one was around 1 kHz while the other was around 2 kHz (across-frequency condition). In the fixed-level conditions, difference limens decreased (improved) with both increasing duration and level, as found in previous studies. In the roving-level conditions, difference limens increased and the dependence on duration and level decreased. Difference limens in the across-frequency conditions were generally highest and showed very little dependence on either stimulus duration or level. The results may be understood in terms of different internal noise components with additive variances: In the fixed-level conditions, sensation noise, which is dependent on stimulus attributes such as duration and level, is dominant. In more difficult conditions, where trace-memory and/or across-channel comparisons are required, a more central, stimulus-independent noise dominates.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying the ability of human listeners to recognize speech in the presence of background noise are still imperfectly understood. However, there is mounting evidence that the medial olivocochlear system plays an important role, via efferents that exert a suppressive effect on the response of the basilar membrane. The current paper presents a computer modeling study that investigates the possible role of this activity on speech intelligibility in noise. A model of auditory efferent processing [Ferry, R. T., and Meddis, R. (2007). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 122, 3519-3526] is used to provide acoustic features for a statistical automatic speech recognition system, thus allowing the effects of efferent activity on speech intelligibility to be quantified. Performance of the "basic" model (without efferent activity) on a connected digit recognition task is good when the speech is uncorrupted by noise but falls when noise is present. However, recognition performance is much improved when efferent activity is applied. Furthermore, optimal performance is obtained when the amount of efferent activity is proportional to the noise level. The results obtained are consistent with the suggestion that efferent suppression causes a "release from adaptation" in the auditory-nerve response to noisy speech, which enhances its intelligibility.},

abstract = {Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) iso-suppression tuning curves (STC) were generated in 15 normal-hearing adults and 16 healthy term-born neonates for three f2 frequencies. The 2f1-f2 DPOAE was elicited using f2/f1 = 1.2, LI = 1.2, LI = 65 and L2 = 50 dB SPL. A suppressor tone was presented at frequencies ranging from 1 octave below to 1/4 octave above f2 and varied in level until DPOAE amplitude was reduced by 6 dB. The suppressor level required for 6 dB suppression was plotted as function of suppressor frequency to generate a DPOAE STC. Forward-masked psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTC) were obtained for three of the adult subjects. Results indicate that DPOAE STCs are stable and show minimal inter- and intra-subject variability. The tip of the STC is consistently centered around the f2 region and STCs are similar in shape, width (Q10) and slope to VIIIth-nerve TCs. PTCs and STCs measured in the same subject showed similar trends, although PTCs had narrower width and steeper slope. Neonatal STCs were recorded at 3000 and 6000 Hz only and were comparable in shape, width and slope to adult STCs. Results suggest: (1) suppression of the 2f1-f2 DPOAE may provide an indirect measure of cochlear frequency resolution in humans and (2) cochlear tuning, and associated active processes in the cochlea, are mature by term birth for at least mid- and high-frequencies. These results provide significant impetus for continued study of DPOAE suppression as a means of evaluating cochlear frequency resolution in humans.},

abstract = {Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE) were studied in a bird, the barn owl. They were found in 79% of the ears investigated, and each emitting ear generated on average 1.9 emissions. Their peak sound-pressure levels lay between -5.8 and 10.3 dB, and their centre frequencies between 2.3 and 10.5 kHz. The SOAE originated primarily in the upper quarter of the animal's hearing range, and derived from a specialized area previously described as being within an auditory fovea. Indeed, 93% of the emissions had centre frequencies above 7.5 kHz. The median of the frequency distances between neighbouring SOAE was 406 Hz (0.058 oct). The 3 dB bandwidth of the emissions depended on their amplitude above the noise: for SOAE whose level exceeded 10 dB above the noise floor, the 3 dB bandwidths ranged between 4.5 and 11.4 Hz. SOAE frequencies were temperature sensitive. Raising the temperature shifted the emissions to higher frequencies, and vice versa (the frequency shifted on average 0.039 oct/degrees C). External tones could suppress the level of SOAE, an effect that was highly tuned. For SOAE with frequencies between 2.5 and 10.5 kHz, the Q(10dB) values of 2 dB iso-suppression tuning curves (STC) varied from 1.07 to 10.40. The best thresholds of 2 dB STC were generally below 15 dB SPL.},

In those with sensorineural hearing loss, it was found that deficits in localization accuracy in different regions of auditory space could be related to different configurations of hearing loss. For example, there were associations between vertical plane discrimination and high-frequency sensitivity; and front-rear discrimination and mid-to-high-frequency sensitivity. These results agree with theoretical expectations, while the outcome overall contrasts with previous reports that localization performance is unrelated to audiometric configuration. A comparison of 13 listeners with conductive/mixed types of impairment with a sensorineural-loss group, matched for degree of loss, showed that a conductive component adds significantly to localization disturbance, particularly in the horizontal plane. The probable reason is a disturbance of low-frequency interaural time cues, and this occurs because a higher proportion of low-frequency sound is likely to be transmitted via bone conduction relative to air conduction. Correlations between hearing loss and localization are only moderate, suggesting that aspects of hearing impairment, in addition to simple attenuation, may also reduce auditory localization performance.},

abstract = {These experiments tested the hypothesis that detection of frequency modulation (FM) at very low rates depends mainly on temporal information (phase locking to the carrier) for carriers below about 5 kHz, whereas FM detection at higher rates (10 Hz and above) depends mainly on changes in the excitation pattern (a "place" mechanism). In experiment 1, thresholds for detecting FM were measured for a wide range of carrier frequencies (0.25-6 kHz) for modulation rates, fm, of 2, 5, 10, and 20 Hz. Thresholds were determined when FM only was present and when the carriers in both intervals of a forced-choice trial were amplitude modulated at the same rate as the FM with a modulation index of 0.333. The phase of the amplitude modulation (AM) relative to the FM was randomly selected on each trial, in order to disrupt cues for FM detection based on changes in the excitation pattern. For carrier frequencies up to 4 kHz, the deleterious effect of the added AM increased with increasing fm. For the 6-kHz carrier, the deleterious effect was independent of fm. In experiment 2, psychometric functions were measured for detecting combined FM and AM of a 1-kHz carrier, with fm = 2 Hz, as a function of the relative phase of the modulators. The modulation depths for AM and FM were chosen so that each would be equally detectable if presented alone. This was done both in quiet and in the presence of noise designed to mask either the lower or the upper side of the excitation pattern. In contrast to earlier results obtained with fm = 10 Hz [Moore and Sek, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 96, 741-751 (1994)], only small effects of relative modulator phase were found. Experiment 3, was similar to experiment 2, except that all measurements were done in quiet, and carrier frequencies of 0.25, 1.0, and 6.0 kHz were used. There were no effects of relative modulator phase for the 0.25-kHz carrier, small effects for the 1-kHz carrier, and large effects for the 6-kHz carrier. The pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that both temporal and place mechanisms are involved in FM detection. The temporal mechanism dominates for carriers below about 4 kHz, and for very low modulation rates. The place mechanism dominates for high carrier frequencies, and for lower carrier frequencies when stimuli are frequency modulated at high rates.},

abstract = {Early studies of intuitive judgment and decision making conducted with the late Amos Tversky are reviewed in the context of two related concepts: an analysis of accessibility, the ease with which thoughts come to mind; a distinction between effortless intuition and deliberate reasoning. Intuitive thoughts, like percepts, are highly accessible. Determinants and consequences of accessibility help explain the central results of prospect theory, framing effects, the heuristic process of attribute substitution, and the characteristic biases that result from the substitution of nonextensional for extensional attributes. Variations in the accessibility of rules explain the occasional corrections of intuitive judgments. The study of biases is compatible with a view of intuitive thinking and decision making as generally skilled and successful.},

abstract = {In the experiments reported here, perceived speaker identity was controlled by manipulating the fundamental frequency (F0) range of carrier phrases in which speech tokens were embedded. In the first experiment, words from two "hood"-"hud" continua were synthesized with different F0. The words were then embedded in synthetic carrier phrases with intonation contours which reduced perceived speaker identity differences for test items with different F0. The results indicated that when perceived speaker identity differences were reduced, the effect of F0 on vowel identification was also reduced. Experiment 2 indicated that when items presented in carrier phrases are matched for speaker identity and F0 with items in isolation, there is no effect for presentation in a carrier phrase. Experiment 3 involved the presentation of vowels from the "hood"-"hud" continuum in two different intonational contexts which were judged to have been produced by different speakers, even though the F0 of the test word was identical in the two contexts. There was a shift in identification as a result of the intonational context which was interpreted as evidence for the role of perceived identity in vowel normalization. Overall, the experiments suggest that perceived speaker identity is a better predictor of vowel normalization effects than is intrinsic F0. This indicates that the role of F0 in vowel normalization is mediated through perceived speaker identity.},

abstract = {This study investigated the interaction between hearing loss, reverberation, and age on the benefit of spatially separating multiple masking talkers from a target talker. Four listener groups were tested based on hearing status and age. On every trial listeners heard three different sentences spoken simultaneously by different female talkers. Listeners reported keywords from the target sentence, which was presented at a fixed and known location. Maskers were colocated with the target or presented from spatially separated and symmetrically placed loudspeakers, creating a situation with no simple "better-ear." Reverberation was also varied. The target-to-masker ratio at threshold for identification of the fixed-level target was measured by adapting the level of the maskers. On average, listeners with hearing loss showed less spatial release from masking than normal-hearing listeners. Age was a significant factor although small differences in hearing sensitivity across age groups may have contributed to this effect. Spatial release was reduced in the more reverberant room condition but in most cases a significant advantage remained. These results provide evidence for a large benefit of spatial separation in a multitalker situation that is likely due to perceptual factors. However, this benefit is significantly reduced by both hearing loss and reverberation.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:Auditory processing disorder (APD) describes a mixed and poorly understood listening problem characterised by poor speech perception, especially in challenging environments. APD may include an inherited component, and this may be major, but studies reviewed here of children with long-term otitis media with effusion (OME) provide strong evidence for changes in auditory processing acquired through altered experience (deprivation) and brain plasticity. Whether inherited or acquired, it is suggested that APD may be reversed by active learning. Training tunes both bottom-up and top-down neural mechanisms, some that are specific to the trained stimulus and some that reflect more generalised arousal. APD and its treatment therefore provide examples of brain plasticity working either in a negative or in a positive way to modulate listening.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:(1) Readers will be able to discuss APD in the context of inheritance and experience. (2) Readers will be able to explain how OME has been shown to alter auditory processing. (3) Readers will be able to list examples of good and bad brain plasticity. (4) Readers will be able to explain what auditory learning is, list some of its properties, and provide examples of its application in therapy for communication disorders.},

abstract = {The mammalian auditory cortex normally undergoes rapid and progressive functional maturation. Here we show that rearing infant rat pups in continuous, moderate-level noise delayed the emergence of adultlike topographic representational order and the refinement of response selectivity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) long beyond normal developmental benchmarks. When those noise-reared adult rats were subsequently exposed to a pulsed pure-tone stimulus, A1 rapidly reorganized, demonstrating that exposure-driven plasticity characteristic of the critical period was still ongoing. These results demonstrate that A1 organization is shaped by a young animal's exposure to salient, structured acoustic inputs-and implicate noise as a risk factor for abnormal child development.},

abstract = {1. Previous studies of the superior olive of echolocating bats suggest that the lateral superior olive (LSO) retains the same structure and function as in other mammals but that the medial superior olive (MSO) is different in structure and possibly also in function. The present study is an examination of this idea in Pteronotus parnellii, a bat that has a large and well-defined MSO. 2. Using pure tones presented via earphones, we obtained data on frequency tuning for 60 single units and 96 multiunits in LSO and 94 single units and 154 multiunits in MSO. Of these we also obtained binaural response characteristics from 55 single units in LSO and 72 single units in MSO. 3. LSO and MSO each have a complete tonotopic representation, arranged in a sequence similar to that of other mammals studied. However, in both LSO and MSO there is an expanded representation of the frequencies around 60 kHz, the main frequency component of the bat's echolocation call; there is another expanded representation of the range around 90 kHz, the third harmonic of the call. The expansion of these frequency ranges suggests that the functions of LSO and MSO in Pteronotus are related to echolocation behavior. 4. The binaural characteristics of cells in LSO were essentially the same as those seen in other mammals. Most LSO units (93%) were excited by the ipsilateral ear and inhibited by the contralateral ear. The responses of nearly all LSO units were completely suppressed when the sound level at the two ears was equal. 5. The binaural characteristics of cells in MSO were different from those in nonecholocating mammals. Most MSO units (72%) were excited by the contralateral ear but were neither excited nor inhibited by the ipsilateral ear. Of the remaining units, 21% were excited by the contralateral ear and inhibited by the ipsilateral ear, and only 6% were excited by both ears. 6. The temporal discharge patterns of units in MSO differed from the tonic response pattern seen in LSO. Most MSO units had phasic response patterns, with a few spikes at the onset or offset of the stimulus; the response often changed from ON to OFF depending on stimulus frequency. 7. The results support the idea that in evolution LSO has remained unchanged, whereas MSO has undergone adaptation. The function of LSO in Pteronotus seems to be identical to that in other mammals, i.e., analysis of interaural sound level differences to derive azimuthal location. The function of MSO in Pteronotus must be different from that in nonecholocating mammals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The discharge rates of single auditory-nerve fibers responding to best-frequency (BF) tones of varying level presented simultaneously with fixed level broadband noise were recorded with and without electrical stimulation of the crossed olivocochlear bundle (COCB). In the absence of COCB stimulation, monotonic increases in noise level produce monotonic increases in the low-level noise-driven response rate of auditory nerve fibers. As a result of adaptation, these increases in noise-driven response rate produce monotonic decreases in saturation discharge rate. At high noise levels, these compressive effects may eliminate the differential rate response of auditory nerve fibers to BF tones. COCB stimulation can restore this differential rate response by producing large decreases in noise-driven response rate and large increases in saturation discharge rate. In backgrounds of quiet, COCB stimulation is known to shift the dynamic range of single auditory nerve fiber BF tone responses to higher stimulus levels. In the presence of background noise, COCB stimulation produces upward shift of dynamic range, which decreases with increasing noise level. At high noise levels, COCB-induced decompression of rate-level functions may occur with little or no dynamic range shift. This enables auditory nerve fibers to signal changes in tone level with changes in discharge rate at lower signal-to-noise ratios than would be possible otherwise. Broadband noise also produces upward shift of the dynamic range of single auditory nerve fiber BF tone response. Noise-induced dynamic range shift of BF tone response was measured as a function of noise level with and without COCB stimulation. COCB stimulation elevates the threshold of noise-induced dynamic range shift. This shift is thought to result from two-tone rate suppression. Increases in the threshold of noise-induced shift due to COCB stimulation therefore suggests an interaction between the mechanism of two-tone rate suppression and the mechanism by which COCB stimulation produces dynamic range shift. These interactions were further investigated by recording auditory nerve fiber rate responses to fixed-level BF excitor tones presented simultaneously with fixed-frequency variable level suppressor tones. Rate responses were recorded with and without COCB stimulation. Experimental results were quantified using a phenomenological model of two-tone rate suppression presented by Sachs and Abbas.},

abstract = {The recent report by Peter Dallos and colleagues of the gene and protein responsible for outer hair cell somatic motility (Zheng, Shen, He, Long, Madison, {\&} Dallos, 2000), and the work of James Hudspeth and colleagues demonstrating that vestibular stereocilia are capable of providing power that may boost the vibration of structures within the inner ear (Martin {\&} Hudspeth, 1999), presents the tantalizing possibility that we may not be far away from answering the question what drives mechanical amplification in the mammalian cochlea? This article reviews the evidence for and against each of somatic motility as the motor, and a motor in the hair cell bundle, producing cochlear mechanical amplification. We consider three models based on somatic motility as the motor and two based on a motor in the hair cell bundle. Available evidence supports a hair cell bundle motor in nonmammals but the upper frequency limit of mammalian hearing in general exceeds that of nonmammals, in many cases by an order of magnitude or more. Only time will tell whether an evolutionary dichotomy exists (Manley, Kirk, K{\"o}ppl, {\&} Yates, 2001).},

abstract = {Hearing one's own voice is important for regulating ongoing speech and for mapping speech sounds onto articulator movements. However, it is currently unknown whether attention mediates changes in the relationship between motor commands and their acoustic output, which are necessary as growth and aging inevitably cause changes to the vocal tract. In this study, participants produced vocalizations while they heard their vocal pitch persistently shifted downward one semitone in both single- and dual-task conditions. During the single-task condition, participants vocalized while passively viewing a visual stream. During the dual-task condition, participants vocalized while also monitoring a visual stream for target letters, forcing participants to divide their attention. Participants' vocal pitch was measured across each vocalization, to index the extent to which their ongoing vocalization was modified as a result of the deviant auditory feedback. Smaller compensatory responses were recorded during the dual-task condition, suggesting that divided attention interfered with the use of auditory feedback for the regulation of ongoing vocalizations. Participants' vocal pitch was also measured at the beginning of each vocalization, before auditory feedback was available, to assess the extent to which the deviant auditory feedback was used to modify subsequent speech motor commands. Smaller changes in vocal pitch at vocalization onset were recorded during the dual-task condition, suggesting that divided attention diminished sensorimotor learning. Together, the results of this study suggest that attention is required for the speech motor control system to make optimal use of auditory feedback for the regulation and planning of speech motor commands.},

abstract = {Merging the information from different senses is essential for successful interaction with real-life situations. Indeed, sensory integration can reduce perceptual ambiguity, speed reactions, or change the qualitative sensory experience. It is widely held that integration occurs at later processing stages and mostly in higher association cortices; however, recent studies suggest that sensory convergence can occur in primary sensory cortex. A good model for early convergence proved to be the auditory cortex, which can be modulated by visual and tactile stimulation; however, given the large number and small size of auditory fields, neither human imaging nor microelectrode recordings have systematically identified which fields are susceptible to multisensory influences. To reconcile findings from human imaging with anatomical knowledge from nonhuman primates, we exploited high-resolution imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) of the macaque monkey to study the modulation of auditory processing by visual stimulation. Using a functional parcellation of auditory cortex, we localized modulations to individual fields. Our results demonstrate that both primary (core) and nonprimary (belt) auditory fields can be activated by the mere presentation of visual scenes. Audiovisual convergence was restricted to caudal fields [prominently the core field (primary auditory cortex) and belt fields (caudomedial field, caudolateral field, and mediomedial field)] and continued in the auditory parabelt and the superior temporal sulcus. The same fields exhibited enhancement of auditory activation by visual stimulation and showed stronger enhancement for less effective stimuli, two characteristics of sensory integration. Together, these findings reveal multisensory modulation of auditory processing prominently in caudal fields but also at the lowest stages of auditory cortical processing.},

abstract = {The detection of binaural interaction is of diagnostic interest in patients with central auditory processing disorders (CAPDs), as binaural hearing tasks are frequently affected in these patients. Owing to the comorbidity associated with disorders such as an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, pathological results in subjective tests often show extra-auditory factors such as reduced attention rather than impaired central auditory function. Therefore, objective measures for auditory processing disorders are essential. The binaural interaction component (BIC), which is the arithmetical difference between the sum of the monaurally evoked auditory potentials of each ear and the binaurally evoked brainstem potentials, has been used as an objective measure of binaural interaction in humans. BIC measurements can therefore be considered as a possible diagnostic tool in CAPD patients. One aim of the present study was to examine whether and to what extent BIC measurements are capable of differentiating between normal children and children 'at risk for CAPD'. BIC measurements were performed on 17 children at risk for CAPD and in a group of 25 children with normal results in the central audiometric tests used. Using the presence or absence of clearly demonstrable BIC waveforms as an indication of whether a CAPD is present or not, a sensitivity and specificity of 76% could be achieved. We conclude that BIC measurements might be of some diagnostic value in CAPD patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:This review covers the articles published between 2010 and early 2011 that presented new findings on inner-ear efferents and their ability to modulate hair cell function.

RECENT FINDINGS:Studies published within the review period have increased our understanding of efferent mechanisms on hair cells in the cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelium and provide insights on efferent contributions to the plasticity of bilateral auditory processing. The central nervous system controls the sensitivity of hair cells to physiological stimuli by regulating the gain of hair cell electromechanical amplification and modulating the efficiency of hair cell-eighth nerve transmission. A notable advance in the last year has been animal and human studies that have examined the contribution of the olivocochlear efferents to sound localization, particularly in a noisy environment.

SUMMARY:Acoustic activation of olivocochlear fibers provides a clinical test for the integrity of the peripheral auditory system and has provided new understanding about the function and limitations of the cochlear amplifier. Although similar tests may be possible in the efferent vestibular system, they have not yet been developed. The structural and functional similarities of the sensory epithelia in the inner ear offer hope that testing procedures may be developed that will allow reliable testing of the vestibular hair cell function.},

abstract = {Based on current literature, the afferents of the superior olivary complex (SOC) are described including those from the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and auditory cortex. Intrinsic SOC afferents and non-auditory afferents from the serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems are also described. New data are provided that show a differential distribution of serotoninergic afferents within the SOC: serotoninergic fibers were relatively sparse in the lateral and medial superior olives and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and were most numerous in periolivary regions. There are variations in the density of serotoninergic fibers within periolivary regions themselves. New data is also provided on auditory and non-auditory afferents to SOC neurons, which have known targets. These include: cochlear nucleus afferents to periolivary (lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body, LNTB) cells that project to the inferior colliculus; cortical afferents to periolivary (ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, VNTB) cells that project to the cochlear nucleus; and serotoninergic and noradrenergic afferents to periolivary (LNTB and VNTB) cells that project to the cochlear nucleus. The relationships between other types of afferents and SOC neurons with known projections are also described as functional circuits. The circuits include those that are part of the ascending auditory system (to the inferior and superior colliculi, lateral lemniscus, and medial geniculate nucleus), the descending auditory system (to the cochlea and cochlear nucleus), and the middle ear reflex circuits.},

abstract = {In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles. These vibrations produce displacement waves that travel on the elongated and spirally wound basilar membrane (BM). As they travel, waves grow in amplitude, reaching a maximum and then dying out. The location of maximum BM motion is a function of stimulus frequency, with high-frequency waves being localized to the "base" of the cochlea (near the stapes) and low-frequency waves approaching the "apex" of the cochlea. Thus each cochlear site has a characteristic frequency (CF), to which it responds maximally. BM vibrations produce motion of hair cell stereocilia, which gates stereociliar transduction channels leading to the generation of hair cell receptor potentials and the excitation of afferent auditory nerve fibers. At the base of the cochlea, BM motion exhibits a CF-specific and level-dependent compressive nonlinearity such that responses to low-level, near-CF stimuli are sensitive and sharply frequency-tuned and responses to intense stimuli are insensitive and poorly tuned. The high sensitivity and sharp-frequency tuning, as well as compression and other nonlinearities (two-tone suppression and intermodulation distortion), are highly labile, indicating the presence in normal cochleae of a positive feedback from the organ of Corti, the "cochlear amplifier." This mechanism involves forces generated by the outer hair cells and controlled, directly or indirectly, by their transduction currents. At the apex of the cochlea, nonlinearities appear to be less prominent than at the base, perhaps implying that the cochlear amplifier plays a lesser role in determining apical mechanical responses to sound. Whether at the base or the apex, the properties of BM vibration adequately account for most frequency-specific properties of the responses to sound of auditory nerve fibers.},

However, children{\textquoteright}s ability to localize in noise and in the front/back (F/B) dimension are scantily studied. To address this, the first part of this study investigated localization-in-noise ability of children vs young adults in two maskers: broadband noise (BBN) and speech-babble (SB) at three signal-to-noise ratios: 􏵱12, 􏵱6, and 0 dB. In the second part, relationship between binaural medial olivocochlear system (MOC) function and localization-in-noise was investigated. In both studies, 21 children and 21 young adults participated. Results indicate, while children are able to differentiate sounds arriving in the F/B dimension on par with adults in quiet and in BBN, larger differences were found for SB. Accuracy of children{\textquoteright}s localization in noise (for both maskers) in the lateral plane was also poorer than adults{\textquoteright}. Significant differences in binaural MOC interaction (mBIC; the difference between the sum of two monaural- and binaural-MOC strength) between adults and children were also found. For reasons which are not clear, adult F/B localization in BBN correlates better with mBIC while children{\textquoteright}s F/B localization in SB correlated better with binaural MOC strength. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study is to determine how combinations of noise levels and reverberation typical of ranges found in current classrooms will affect speech recognition performance of typically developing children with normal speech, language, and hearing and to compare their performance with that of adults with normal hearing. Speech recognition performance was measured using the Bamford-Kowal-Bench Speech in Noise test. A virtual test paradigm represented the signal reaching a student seated in the back of a classroom with a volume of 228 m and with varied reverberation time (0.3, 0.6, and 0.8 sec). The signal to noise ratios required for 50% performance (SNR-50) and for 95% performance were determined for groups of children aged 6 to 12 yrs and a group of young adults with normal hearing.

DESIGN:This is a cross-sectional developmental study incorporating a repeated measures design. Experimental variables included age and reverberation time. A total of 63 children with normal hearing and typically developing speech and language and nine adults with normal hearing were tested. Nine children were included in each age group (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 yrs).

RESULTS:The SNR-50 increased significantly with increased reverberation and decreased significantly with increasing age. On average, children required positive SNRs for 50% performance, whereas thresholds for adults were close to 0 dB or <0 dB for the conditions tested. When reverberant SNR-50 was compared with adult SNR-50 without reverberation, adults did not exhibit an SNR loss, but children aged 6 to 8 yrs exhibited a moderate SNR loss and children aged 9 to 12 yrs exhibited a mild SNR loss. To obtain average speech recognition scores of 95% at the back of the classroom, an SNR > or = 10 dB is required for all children at the lowest reverberation time, of > or = 12 dB for children up to age 11 yrs at the 0.6-sec reverberant condition, and of > or = 15 dB for children aged 7 to 11 yrs at the 0.8-sec condition. The youngest children require even higher SNRs in the 0.8-sec condition.

CONCLUSIONS:Results highlight changes in speech recognition performance with age in elementary school children listening to speech in noisy, reverberant classrooms. The more reverberant the environment, the better the SNR required. The younger the child, the better the SNR required. Results support the importance of attention to classroom acoustics and emphasize the need for maximizing SNR in classrooms, especially in classrooms designed for early childhood grades.},

abstract = {In this study, the influence of stimulus context and audibility on sentence recognition was assessed in 60 normal-hearing children, 23 hearing-impaired children, and 20 normal-hearing adults. Performance-intensity (PI) functions were obtained for 60 semantically correct and 60 semantically anomalous sentences. For each participant, an audibility index (AI) was calculated at each presentation level, and a logistic function was fitted to rau-transformed percent-correct values to estimate the SPL and AI required to achieve 70% performance. For both types of sentences, there was a systematic age-related shift in the PI functions, suggesting that young children require a higher AI to achieve performance equivalent to that of adults. Improvement in performance with the addition of semantic context was statistically significant only for the normal-hearing 5-year-olds and adults. Data from the hearing-impaired children showed age-related trends that were similar to those of the normal-hearing children, with the majority of individual data falling within the 5th and 95th percentile of normal. The implications of these findings in terms of hearing-aid fitting strategies for young children are discussed.},

abstract = {The sound pressure of delayed evoked oto-acoustic emissions was measured as a function of the sound pressure of the stimulating sound impulse. They are directly proportional for sensation levels of the stimuli lower than about 20 dB; above that level, the emission saturates. Spontaneous emissions lying in the same frequency range as evoked emissions seem to influence this simple relation. Within the linear range, delayed emissions superimpose linearly even throughout long lasting delayed emissions. Short test tone bursts were used as test sound, to produce masking-period patterns, and as stimulus, to produce suppression-period patterns, respectively, while low-frequency Gaussian-shaped pressure impulses served as masker and as suppressor. The very close relation of the two patterns is indicated by their mirrored forms. This is considered directly relevant to the phenomenon of masking.},

abstract = {Coupling of thalamocortical networks through synchronous oscillations at gamma frequencies (30-80 Hz) has been suggested as a mechanism for binding of auditory sensory information into an object representation, which then becomes accessible for perception and cognition. This study investigated whether contralateral noise interferes with this step of central auditory processing. Neuromagnetic 40-Hz oscillations were examined in young healthy participants while they listened to amplitude-modulated sound in one ear and a multi-talker masking noise in the contralateral ear. Participants were engaged in a gap-detection task, for which their behavioural performance declined under masking. The amplitude modulation of the stimulus elicited steady 40-Hz oscillations with sources in bilateral auditory cortices. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of phase synchrony between source activity and the stimulus revealed two oscillatory components; the first was indicated by an instant onset in phase synchrony with the stimulus while the second showed a 200-ms time constant of gradual increase in phase synchrony after phase resetting by the gap. Masking abolished only the second component. This coincided with masking-related decrease of the P2 wave of the transient auditory-evoked responses whereas the N1 wave, reflecting early sensory processing, was unaffected. Given that the P2 response has been associated with object representation, we propose that the first 40-Hz component is related to representation of low-level sensory input whereas the second is related to internal auditory processing in thalamocortical networks. The observed modulation of oscillatory activity is discussed as reflecting a neural mechanism critical for speech understanding in noise.},

AEPs included auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), middle latency responses (MLRs), and late cortical responses (P1, N1, P2, P3). Late cortical responses were recorded using an active listening oddball procedure. Auditory processing disorders were suspected in the LD children after a psychologist found phonologic processing and auditory memory problems. A control group of 10 age- and gender-matched children with no hearing or reported learning difficulties was also tested. Teacher ratings of classroom listening and SCAN Competing Words and Staggered Spondaic Word scores were poorer in the LD children. There were minor ABR latency differences between the two groups. Wave Na of the MLR was later and Nb was smaller in the LD group. The main differences in cortical responses were that P1 was earlier and P3 was later and smaller in the LD group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent findings of a tight coupling between visual and auditory association cortices during multisensory perception in monkeys and humans raise the question whether consistent paired presentation of simple visual and auditory stimuli prompts conditioned responses in unimodal auditory regions or multimodal association cortex once visual stimuli are presented in isolation in a post-conditioning run. To address this issue fifteen healthy participants partook in a "silent" sparse temporal event-related fMRI study. In the first (visual control) habituation phase they were presented with briefly red flashing visual stimuli. In the second (auditory control) habituation phase they heard brief telephone ringing. In the third (conditioning) phase we coincidently presented the visual stimulus (CS) paired with the auditory stimulus (UCS). In the fourth phase participants either viewed flashes paired with the auditory stimulus (maintenance, CS-) or viewed the visual stimulus in isolation (extinction, CS+) according to a 5:10 partial reinforcement schedule. The participants had no other task than attending to the stimuli and indicating the end of each trial by pressing a button.

RESULTS:During unpaired visual presentations (preceding and following the paired presentation) we observed significant brain responses beyond primary visual cortex in the bilateral posterior auditory association cortex (planum temporale, planum parietale) and in the right superior temporal sulcus whereas the primary auditory regions were not involved. By contrast, the activity in auditory core regions was markedly larger when participants were presented with auditory stimuli.

CONCLUSION:These results demonstrate involvement of multisensory and auditory association areas in perception of unimodal visual stimulation which may reflect the instantaneous forming of multisensory associations and cannot be attributed to sensation of an auditory event. More importantly, we are able to show that brain responses in multisensory cortices do not necessarily emerge from associative learning but even occur spontaneously to simple visual stimulation.},

abstract = {Working memory (WM) tasks involve several interrelated processes during which past information must be transiently maintained, recalled, and compared with test items according to previously instructed rules. It is not clear whether the rule-specific comparisons of perceptual with memorized items are only performed in previously identified frontal and parietal WM areas or whether these areas orchestrate such comparisons by feedback to sensory cortex. We tested the latter hypothesis by focusing on auditory cortex (AC) areas with low-noise functional magnetic resonance imaging in a 2-back WM task involving frequency-modulated (FM) tones. The control condition was a 0-back task on the same stimuli. Analysis of the group data identified an area on right planum temporale equally activated by both tasks and an area on the left planum temporale specifically involved in the 2-back task. A region of interest analysis in each individual revealed that activation on the left planum temporale in the 2-back task positively correlated with the task performance of the subjects. This strongly suggests a prominent role of the AC in 2-back WM tasks. In conjunction with previous findings on FM processing, the left lateralized effect presumably reflects the complex sequential processing demand of the 2-back matching to sample task.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:This study aimed to characterize horizontal plane sound localization in interfering noise at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and to compare performance across normal-hearing listeners and users of unilateral and bilateral cochlear implants (CIs). CI users report difficulties with listening in noisy environments. Although their difficulties with speech understanding have been investigated in several studies, the ability to localize sounds in background noise has not extensively been examined, despite the benefits of binaural hearing being greatest in noisy situations. Sound localization is a measure of binaural processing and is thus well suited to assessing the benefit of bilateral implantation. The results will inform clinicians and implant manufacturers how to focus their efforts to improve localization with CIs in noisy situations.

DESIGN:Six normal-hearing listeners, four unilateral, and 10 bilateral CI users indicated the perceived location of sound sources using a light pointer method. Target sounds were noise pulses played from one of 11 loudspeakers placed between -80 and +80 degrees in the frontal horizontal plane in the free field. Localization was assessed in quiet and in diffuse background noise at SNRs between +10 and -7 dB. Speech reception thresholds were measured and their relation to the localization results examined.

RESULTS:Localization performance declined with decreasing SNR: target sounds were perceived closer to the median plane and the standard deviation of responses increased. Localization performance across groups was compared using a measure of "Spatial Resolvability" (SR). This measure gives the angular separation between two sound sources that would enable an ideal observer to correctly distinguish them 69.1% of the time. For all participants SR increased with decreasing SNR, that is, at low SNRs the spatial separation between sound sources remained distinguishable only when it was larger. Normal-hearing participants performed best, with SR between 1.4 and 5.1 degrees in quiet. Bilateral CI users showed SR between 8.3 and 43.6 degrees in quiet, corresponding approximately to the spatial resolution of normal-hearing listeners at an SNR of -5 dB. Most bilateral CI users had lost the ability to correctly determine which side the sound came from at an SNR of -3 dB. Overall, the SNR had to be at least +7 dB to achieve localization performance near to that in quiet for all bilateral CI users. No significant correlation was found between spatial resolution and speech reception thresholds, but the speech processor sensitivity setting did significantly affect performance. Unilateral CI users showed the most severe localization problems, with only two of four participants being able to correctly determine which side sounds came from in quiet.

CONCLUSIONS:This study is the first to examine sound localization with CIs at various SNRs and to compare it with normal hearing. The results confirm that localization with CIs is strongly disrupted in noisy situations. Bilateral CIs were shown to be clearly superior over unilateral CIs for localization in quiet and in noisy situations. With bilateral CIs, localization declined at moderately high absolute noise levels (>63 dB SPL), suggesting that an extension of the acoustic-dynamic range to higher levels would be beneficial. The absence of a relation between speech reception thresholds and spatial resolution highlights the need for additional clinical tests to assess the binaural benefit of a second implant.},

abstract = {The suppression by moderate-level contralateral sound of auditory-nerve-fiber responses to ipsilateral stimuli at the characteristic frequency (CF) was studied in barbiturate-anesthetized cats. The dependence of suppression strength on ipsilateral and contralateral stimulus variables, including level, frequency, bandwidth, and timing relationships, was investigated. The principal findings were: (1) Contralateral-sound suppression is greatest when the ipsilateral stimulus level is within the dynamic range of the unit. (2) When the contralateral stimuli are tones, suppression is greatest when the contralateral tone frequency is at or near CF. (3) Units with CFs above 3-4 kHz are only weakly suppressed by contralateral CF tones but more strongly suppressed by contralateral broad-band noise. (4) Continuous contralateral stimuli are significantly more effective suppressors than are gated stimuli. The characteristics of contralateral-sound suppression are compared with the physiology and anatomy of the uncrossed medial olivocochlear efferents, the subset of efferents which are the primary mediators of the effect.},

abstract = {Auditory processing disorder (APD) affects about 2-5% of children. However, the nature of this disorder is poorly understood. Children with APD typically have difficulties in complex listening situations. One mechanism thought to aid in listening-in-noise is the medial olivocochlear (MOC) inhibition. The purpose of this review was to critically analyze the published data on MOC inhibition in children with APD to determine whether the MOC efferents are involved in these individuals. The otoacoustic emission (OAE) methods used to assay MOC reflex were examined in the context of the current understanding of OAE generation mechanisms. Relevant literature suggests critical differences in the study population and OAE methods. Variables currently known to influence MOC reflex measurements, for example, middle-ear muscle reflexes or OAE signal-to-noise ratio, were not controlled in most studies. The use of potentially weaker OAE methods and the remarkable heterogeneity across studies does not allow for a definite conclusion whether or not the MOC reflex is altered in children with APD. Further carefully designed studies are needed to confirm the involvement of MOC efferents in APD. Knowledge of efferent functioning in children with APD would be mechanistically and clinically beneficial.},

abstract = {An extensive physiological literature, including experimental and clinical studies in humans, demonstrates that activation of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system, by either contralateral sound or electrical stimulation, can produce significant alterations in cochlear function and suggests a role for the MOC system in influencing the auditory behavior of binaural hearing. The present data are from psychophysical studies in nonhuman primates which seek to determine if the noted physiological changes in response to contralateral acoustic stimulation have a perceptual counterpart. Four juvenile Japanese macaques were trained to respond to the presence of 1-s sinusoids, presented to the test ear, in an operant reinforcement paradigm. Thresholds were compared for frequencies ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 kHz in quiet, with thresholds measured when continuous, two octave-band noise, centered on the test tone frequency, was presented in the contralateral ear. Contralateral noise was presented at levels of 10-60 dB above detection threshold for the test-tone frequency. While some variability was evident across subjects, both in the frequency distribution and magnitude (as a function of contralateral noise level), all subjects exhibited an increase, or suppression of thresholds in the presence of contralateral noise. On average, thresholds increased systematically with contralateral noise level, to a peak of 7 dB. In one subject, the threshold increase seen with contralateral noise was significantly reduced when the MOC was surgically sectioned on the floor of the IVth ventricle. The characteristics of the measured shifts in behavioral thresholds, in the presence of contralateral noise reported here, are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to both efferent physiological suppression effects and psychophysical central masking threshold shifts which have been reported previously. These data suggest that at least some aspects of "central masking" are efferent-mediated peripheral processes, and that the term "central masking" may be incorrect.},

abstract = {The ability to locate the direction of a target sound in a background of competing sources is critical to the survival of many species and important for human communication. Nevertheless, brain mechanisms that provide for such accurate localization abilities remain poorly understood. In particular, it remains unclear how the auditory brain is able to extract reliable spatial information directly from the source when competing sounds and reflections dominate all but the earliest moments of the sound wave reaching each ear. We developed a stimulus mimicking the mutual relationship of sound amplitude and binaural cues, characteristic to reverberant speech. This stimulus, named amplitude modulated binaural beat, allows for a parametric and isolated change of modulation frequency and phase relations. Employing magnetoencephalography and psychoacoustics it is demonstrated that the auditory brain uses binaural information in the stimulus fine structure only during the rising portion of each modulation cycle, rendering spatial information recoverable in an otherwise unlocalizable sound. The data suggest that amplitude modulation provides a means of "glimpsing" low-frequency spatial cues in a manner that benefits listening in noisy or reverberant environments.},

abstract = {The contribution of spectral cues to human sound localization was investigated by removing cues in 1/2-, 1- or 2-octave bands in the frequency range above 4 kHz. Localization responses were given by placing an acoustic pointer at the same apparent position as a virtual target. The pointer was generated by filtering a 100-ms harmonic complex with equalized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Listeners controlled the pointer via a hand-held stick that rotated about a fixed point. In the baseline condition, the target, a 200-ms noise burst, was filtered with the same HRTFs as the pointer. In other conditions, the spectral information within a certain frequency band was removed by replacing the directional transfer function within this band with the average transfer of this band. Analysis of the data showed that removing cues in 1/2-octave bands did not affect localization, whereas for the 2-octave band correct localization was virtually impossible. The results obtained for the 1-octave bands indicate that up-down cues are located mainly in the 6-12-kHz band, and front-back cues in the 8-16-kHz band. The interindividual spread in response patterns suggests that different listeners use different localization cues. The response patterns in the median plane can be predicted using a model based on spectral comparison of directional transfer functions for target and response directions.},

abstract = {A behavioral measure of the basilar membrane response can be obtained by comparing the growth in forward masking for maskers at, and well below, the signal frequency. Since the off-frequency masker is assumed to be processed linearly at the signal place, the difference in masking growth with level is thought to reflect the compressive response to the on-frequency masker. The present experiment used an electrophysiological analog of this technique, based on measurements of the latency of wave V of the auditory brainstem response elicited by a 4-kHz, 4-ms pure tone, presented at 65 dB SPL. Responses were obtained in quiet and in the presence of either an on-frequency (4 kHz) or an off-frequency (1.8 kHz) pure-tone forward masker. Wave V latency increased with masker level, although the increase was greater for the off-frequency masker than for the on-frequency masker, consistent with a more compressive response to the latter. Response functions generated from the data showed the characteristic shape, with a nearly linear response at lower levels and 4:1 compression at higher levels. However, the breakpoint between the linear region and the compressive region was at about 60 dB SPL, higher than expected on the basis of previous physiological and psychophysical measures.},

abstract = {The precedence effect refers to the fact that humans are able to localize sound in reverberant environments, because the auditory system assigns greater weight to the direct sound (lead) than the later-arriving sound (lag). In this study, absolute sound localization was studied for single source stimuli and for dual source lead-lag stimuli in 4-5 year old children and adults. Lead-lag delays ranged from 5-100 ms. Testing was conducted in free field, with pink noise bursts emitted from loudspeakers positioned on a horizontal arc in the frontal field. Listeners indicated how many sounds were heard and the perceived location of the first- and second-heard sounds. Results suggest that at short delays (up to 10 ms), the lead dominates sound localization strongly at both ages, and localization errors are similar to those with single-source stimuli. At longer delays errors can be large, stemming from over-integration of the lead and lag, interchanging of perceived locations of the first-heard and second-heard sounds due to temporal order confusion, and dominance of the lead over the lag. The errors are greater for children than adults. Results are discussed in the context of maturation of auditory and non-auditory factors.},

abstract = {The frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing depends on not only the passive mechanics of the basilar membrane but also an active amplification of the mechanical stimulus by the cochlear hair cells. The common view is that amplification stems from the somatic motility of the outer hair cells (OHCs), changes in their length impelled by voltage-dependent transitions in the membrane protein prestin. Whether this voltage-controlled mechanism, whose frequency range may be limited by the membrane time constant, has the band width to cover the entire auditory range of mammals is uncertain. However, there is ample evidence for an alternative mode of force generation by hair cells of non-mammals, such as frogs and turtles, which probably lack prestin. The latter process involves active motion of the hair bundle underpinned by conformational changes in the mechanotransducer (MT) channels and activation of one or more isoforms of myosin. This review summarizes evidence for active hair bundle motion and its connection to MT channel adaptation. Key factors for the hair bundle motor to play a role in the mammalian cochlea include the size and speed of force production.},

abstract = {Intense noise damages the cochlear organ of Corti, particularly the outer hair cells (OHCs) [1]; however, this epithelium is not innervated by nociceptors of somatosensory ganglia, which detect damage elsewhere in the body. The only sensory neurons innervating the organ of Corti originate from the spiral ganglion, roughly 95% of which innervate exclusively inner hair cells (IHCs) [2-4]. Upon sound stimulation, IHCs release glutamate to activate AMPA-type receptors on these myelinated type-I neurons, which carry the neuronal signals to the cochlear nucleus. The remaining spiral ganglion cells (type IIs) are unmyelinated and contact OHCs [2-4]. Their function is unknown. Using immunoreactivity to cFos, we documented neuronal activation in the brainstem of Vglut3(-/-) mice, in which the canonical auditory pathway (activation of type-I afferents by glutamate released from inner hair cells) is silenced [5, 6]. In these deaf mice, we found responses to noxious noise, which damages hair cells, but not to innocuous noise, in neurons of the cochlear nucleus, but not in the vestibular or trigeminal nuclei. This response originates in the cochlea and not in other areas also stimulated by intense noise (middle ear and vestibule) as it was absent in CD1 mice with selective cochlear degeneration but normal vestibular and somatosensory function. These data imply the existence of an alternative neuronal pathway from cochlea to brainstem that is activated by tissue-damaging noise and does not require glutamate release from IHCs. This detection of noise-induced tissue damage, possibly by type-II cochlear afferents, represents a novel form of sensation that we term auditory nociception.},

abstract = {We live in a complex and dynamically changing acoustic environment. To this end, the auditory cortex of humans has developed the ability to process a remarkable amount of diverse acoustic information with apparent ease. In fact, a phylogenetic comparison of auditory systems reveals that human auditory association cortex in particular has undergone extensive changes relative to that of other species, although our knowledge of this remains incomplete. In contrast to other senses, human auditory cortex receives input that is highly pre-processed in a number of sub-cortical structures; this suggests that even primary auditory cortex already performs quite complex analyses. At the same time, much of the functional role of the various sub-areas in human auditory cortex is still relatively unknown, and a more sophisticated understanding is only now emerging through the use of contemporary electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. The integration of results across the various techniques signify a new era in our knowledge of how human auditory cortex forms basis for auditory experience. This volume on human auditory cortex will have two major parts. In Part A, the principal methodologies currently used to investigate human auditory cortex will be discussed. Each chapter will first outline how the methodology is used in auditory neuroscience, highlighting the challenges of obtaining data from human auditory cortex; second, each methods chapter will provide two or (at most) three brief examples of how it has been used to generate a major result about auditory processing. In Part B, the central questions for auditory processing in human auditory cortex are covered. Each chapter can draw on all the methods introduced in Part A but will focus on a major computational challenge the system has to solve. This volume will constitute an important contemporary reference work on human auditory cortex. Arguably, this will be the first and most focused book on this critical neurological structure. The combination of different methodological and experimental approaches as well as a diverse range of aspects of human auditory perception ensures that this volume will inspire novel insights and spurn future research.},

abstract = {Children have higher auditory backward masking (BM) thresholds than adults. One explanation for this is poor temporal resolution, resulting in difficulty separating brief or rapidly presented sounds. This implies that the auditory temporal window is broader in children than in adults. Alternatively, elevated BM thresholds in children may indicate poor processing efficiency. In this case, children would need a higher signal-to-masker ratio than adults to detect the presence of a signal. This would result in poor performance on a number of psychoacoustic tasks but would be particularly marked in BM due to the compressive nonlinearity of the basilar membrane. The objective of the present study was to examine the competing hypotheses of "temporal resolution" and "efficiency" by measuring BM as a function of signal-to-masker interval in children and adults. The children had significantly higher thresholds than the adults at each of the intervals. Subsequent modeling and analyses showed that the data for both children and adults were best fitted using the same, fixed temporal window. Therefore, the differences in BM threshold between adults and children were not due to differences in temporal resolution but to reduced detection efficiency in the children.},

The present study extends this research by comparing audiologists' and pediatricians' rankings of 58 behavioral symptoms associated with APD and ADHD predominantly inattentive (PI) subtype, the ADHD subtype that presents without hyperactivity and impulsivity. Audiologists ranked the degree to which each symptom pertained to individuals with APD, and pediatricians ranked the same symptom as it relates to ADHD-PI. Item analysis revealed that respondents identified a reasonably exclusive set of behaviors characterizing APD and ADHD-PI. None of the four behaviors ranked 2 SD above the grand means (i.e., inattention, academic difficulties, asking for things to be repeated, and poor listening skills) was ranked in common.},

abstract = {Modulations of human alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) accompany many cognitive processes, but their functional role in auditory perception has proven elusive: Do oscillatory dynamics of alpha reflect acoustic details of the speech signal and are they indicative of comprehension success? Acoustically presented words were degraded in acoustic envelope and spectrum in an orthogonal design, and electroencephalogram responses in the frequency domain were analyzed in 24 participants, who rated word comprehensibility after each trial. First, the alpha power suppression during and after a degraded word depended monotonically on spectral and, to a lesser extent, envelope detail. The magnitude of this alpha suppression exhibited an additional and independent influence on later comprehension ratings. Second, source localization of alpha suppression yielded superior parietal, prefrontal, as well as anterior temporal brain areas. Third, multivariate classification of the time-frequency pattern across participants showed that patterns of late posterior alpha power allowed best for above-chance classification of word intelligibility. Results suggest that both magnitude and topography of late alpha suppression in response to single words can indicate a listener's sensitivity to acoustic features and the ability to comprehend speech under adverse listening conditions.},

abstract = {The cochlear amplifier shows level-dependent function and works optimally at low levels. For this reason, manipulation of stimulus level is a route through which the human cochlear amplifier can be investigated in a noninvasive manner. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) evoked as a function of stimulus level provide a tool for exploration of human cochlear amplifier function and, when applied to neonates, for investigation of cochlear maturation. The current experiment generated 2f1{\textminus}f2 DPOAE ipsilateral suppression tuning curves (STCs) at three primary tone levels and five f2 frequencies in a large group of premature and term neonates and adults. The differences between tuning generated with low- and high-level primary tones was measured to provide a gross estimate of the {\textquotedblleft}tuning enhancement effect{\textquotedblright} attributed to the cochlear amplifier. Other features of the DPOAE suppression tuning curves were measured as well. Consistent with previous reports, at 1500 and 6000 Hz, STCs were narrower, with a steeper slope on the low-frequency flank of the tuning curve in premature neonates versus adults. Additionally, only DPOAE STCs from adults and term neonates became markedly broader and more shallow when recorded with high-level primary tones. It has been hypothesized that the excessive narrowness of suppression tuning and the absence of a level effect on DPOAE STCs recorded in premature neonates reflects a subtle immaturity in cochlear amplifier function just prior to term birth.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions, sounds generated in the inner ear, have become a convenient non-invasive tool to examine the efferent modulation of cochlear mechanics. Activation of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents has been shown to alter the magnitude of these emissions. When the effects of efferent activation on the detailed spectral structures of these emissions have been examined, a shift of the spectral patterns toward higher frequencies has been reported for distortion product and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. Stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) have been proposed as the preferred emission type in the study of efferent modulation due to the simplicity of their production leading to the possibility of clearer interpretation of results. The effects of efferent activation on the complex spectral patterns of SFOAEs have not been examined to the best of our knowledge. We have examined the effects of activating the MOC efferents using broadband noise in normal-hearing humans. The detailed spectral structure of SFOAEs, known as fine structure, was recorded with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation. Results indicate that SFOAEs are reduced in magnitude and their fine structure pushed to higher frequencies by contralateral acoustic stimulation. These changes are similar to those observed in distortion product or spontaneous otoacoustic emissions and behavioral hearing thresholds. Taken together with observations made about magnitude and phase changes in otoacoustic emissions and hearing thresholds upon contralateral acoustic stimulation, all changes in otoacoustic emission and hearing threshold fine structure appear to be driven by a common set of mechanisms. Specifically, frequency shifts in fine structure patterns appear to be linked to changes in SFOAE phase due to contralateral acoustic stimulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The auditory efferent system has unique neuroanatomical pathways that connect the cerebral cortex with sensory receptor cells. Pyramidal neurons located in layers V and VI of the primary auditory cortex constitute descending projections to the thalamus, inferior colliculus, and even directly to the superior olivary complex and to the cochlear nucleus. Efferent pathways are connected to the cochlear receptor by the olivocochlear system, which innervates outer hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. The functional role of the cortico-olivocochlear efferent system remains debated. We hypothesized that auditory cortex basal activity modulates cochlear and auditory-nerve afferent responses through the efferent system.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Cochlear microphonics (CM), auditory-nerve compound action potentials (CAP) and auditory cortex evoked potentials (ACEP) were recorded in twenty anesthetized chinchillas, before, during and after auditory cortex deactivation by two methods: lidocaine microinjections or cortical cooling with cryoloops. Auditory cortex deactivation induced a transient reduction in ACEP amplitudes in fifteen animals (deactivation experiments) and a permanent reduction in five chinchillas (lesion experiments). We found significant changes in the amplitude of CM in both types of experiments, being the most common effect a CM decrease found in fifteen animals. Concomitantly to CM amplitude changes, we found CAP increases in seven chinchillas and CAP reductions in thirteen animals. Although ACEP amplitudes were completely recovered after ninety minutes in deactivation experiments, only partial recovery was observed in the magnitudes of cochlear responses.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These results show that blocking ongoing auditory cortex activity modulates CM and CAP responses, demonstrating that cortico-olivocochlear circuits regulate auditory nerve and cochlear responses through a basal efferent tone. The diversity of the obtained effects suggests that there are at least two functional pathways from the auditory cortex to the cochlea.},

abstract = {The mammalian auditory system contains descending pathways that originate in the cortex and relay at various intermediate levels before reaching the peripheral sensory organ of Corti. The last link in this chain consists of the olivocochlear bundle. The activity of this bundle can be measured through otoacoustic emissions, which are acoustic signatures of the cochlear biomechanical activity. In the present study, it was hypothesized that frequency-specific activation of the olivocochlear bundle in the contralateral ear would show up as frequency-specific variations in otoacoustic emission amplitude in the ipsilateral ear. Two groups of young adult subjects participated in this experiment. Evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded in the ipsilateral ear at two test frequencies (1 and 2 kHz). Subjects had to detect probe tones at a given frequency in background noise in the contralateral ear. Larger efferent activation was measured at test frequencies on which attention is focused. This result provides evidence for an influence of attention on the auditory periphery via descending projections.},

abstract = {Discharge patterns of auditory-nerve fibers in anesthetized cats were obtained for two stimulus levels in response to synthetic stimuli with dynamic characteristics appropriate for selected consonants. A set of stimuli was constructed by preceding a signal that was identified as /da/by another sound that was systematically manipulated so that the entire complex would sound like either /da/, /ada/, /na/, /sa/, /sa/, or others. Discharge rates of auditory-nerve fibers in response to the common /da/-like formant transitions depended on the preceding context. Average discharge rates during these transitions decreased most for fibers whose CFs were in frequency regions where the context had considerable energy. Some effect of the preceding context on fine time patterns of response to the transitions was also found, but the identity of the largest response components (which often corresponded to the formant frequencies) was in general unaffected. Thus the response patterns during the formant transitions contain cues about both the nature of the transitions and the preceding context. A second set of stimuli sounding like /s/ and /c/ was obtained by varying the duration of the rise in amplitude at the onset of a filtered noise burst. At both 45 and 60 dB SPL, there were fibers which showed a more prominent peak in discharge rate at stimulus onset for /c/ than for /s/, but the CF regions that reflected the clearest distinctions depended on stimulus level. The peaks in discharge rate that occur in response to rapid changes in amplitude or spectrum might be used by the central processor as pointers to portions of speech signals that are rich in phonetic information.},

Over 40 different subcortical structures project to the superior colliculus. The more notable among these are grouped under the following categories. Visual structures: ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal area (nucleus of the optic tract, posterior pretectal nucleus, nuclei of the posterior commissure). Auditory structures: inferior colliculus (external and pericentral nuclei), dorsomedial periolivary nucleus, nuclei of the trapezoid body, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. Somatosensory structures: sensory trigeminal complex (all divisions, but mainly the gamma division of nucleus oralis), dorsal column nuclei (mostly cuneate nucleus), and the lateral cervical nucleus. Catecholamine nuclei: locus coeruleus, raphe dorsalis, and the parabrachial nuclei. Cerebellum: medial, interposed, and lateral nuclei, and the perihypoglossal nuclei. Reticular areas: zona incerta, substantia nigra, midbrain tegmentum, nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis, and the hypothalamus. Evidence is presented that only the parabigeminal nucleus, the nucleus of the optic tract, and the posterior pretectal nucleus project to the superficial collicular layers (striatum griseum superficiale and stratum opticum), while all other afferents terminate in the deeper layers of the colliculus. Also presented is information concerning the rostrocaudal distribution of some of these afferent connections. These findings stress the multiplicity and diversity of inputs to the deeper collicular layers, and more specifically, identify multiple sources of the physiologically well-known representations of the somatic and auditory modalities in the colliculus.},

abstract = {Neuromagnetic responses were recorded over the left hemisphere to find out in which cortical area the heard and seen speech are integrated. Auditory stimuli were Finnish/pa/syllables presented together with a videotaped face articulating either the concordant syllable/pa/(84% of stimuli, V = A) or the discordant syllable/ka/(16%, V not equal to A). In some subjects the probabilities were reversed. The subjects heard V not equal to A stimuli as/ta/ or ka. The magnetic responses to infrequent perceptions elicited a specific waveform which could be explained by activity in the supratemporal auditory cortex. The results show that visual information from articulatory movements has an entry into the auditory cortex.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions are typically reduced in amplitude when broadband noise is presented to the contralateral ear. This contralateral suppression is attributed to activation of the medial olivocochlear system, which has an inhibitory effect on outer hair-cell activity. By studying the effects of contralateral noise on cochlear output at different stages of auditory maturation in human neonates, it is possible to describe the timecourse for development of medial efferent system function in humans. The present study recorded 2 f1-f2 distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) in human adults, term and premature neonates at three f2 frequencies: 1500, 3000, and 6000 Hz, using fixed primary tone frequency ratio (f2/f1 = 1.2) and level separation (10 dB, L1 > L2). Average DPOAE growth functions were recorded with and without contralateral broadband noise. Results indicate that contralateral suppression of DPOAEs is absent at 6000 Hz, but present at 1500 and 3000 Hz for all ages. However, DPOAE amplitude from premature neonates was not altered by noise in an adult-like manner; in this age group, DPOAE amplitude was equally likely to by suppressed or enhanced by noise presented contralaterally. Contralateral enhancement may reflect a temporary stage of immaturity in outer hair cell-medial efferent fiber synapses just prior to term birth.},

abstract = {At a cocktail party, one can selectively attend to a single voice and filter out all the other acoustical interferences. How to simulate this perceptual ability remains a great challenge. This paper describes a novel, supervised learning approach to speech segregation, in which a target speech signal is separated from interfering sounds using spatial localization cues: interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural intensity differences (IID). Motivated by the auditory masking effect, the notion of an "ideal" time-frequency binary mask is suggested, which selects the target if it is stronger than the interference in a local time-frequency (T-F) unit. It is observed that within a narrow frequency band, modifications to the relative strength of the target source with respect to the interference trigger systematic changes for estimated ITD and IID. For a given spatial configuration, this interaction produces characteristic clustering in the binaural feature space. Consequently, pattern classification is performed in order to estimate ideal binary masks. A systematic evaluation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio as well as automatic speech recognition performance shows that the resulting system produces masks very close to ideal binary ones. A quantitative comparison shows that the model yields significant improvement in performance over an existing approach. Furthermore, under certain conditions the model produces large speech intelligibility improvements with normal listeners.},

Psychometric functions were fit to each individual's data, and thresholds (signal level required for 75% correct) were interpolated from the fitted functions. Results showed that, on average, the children's thresholds were higher and the slopes of their psychometric functions were shallower than those of the adults. However, the between-subjects variability in the children's data was large, and the performance of many individual children was not well described by group mean performance. One-third of the children produced thresholds that were elevated by an average of 10 dB but psychometric function slopes that were adult-like. Another one-third of the children produced thresholds that were elevated relative to those of the adults by an average of 20 dB and psychometric function slopes that were very shallow. The data from a smaller group of children showed large variability in psychometric function slope and threshold, and for a very few children performance was at chance regardless of the signal level. A replication of the study several months later showed that for most listeners the individual patterns of performance persisted over time.},

abstract = {Based on recommendations by Musiek {\&} Chermak (1994, American Journal of Audiology, 3, 23-27) and ASHA (1996, American Journal of Audiology, 5(2), 41-54), a battery of four commonly used tests was selected and recorded for use in assessing school children. These tests were labeled the Multiple Auditory Processing Assessment (MAPA) and then administered to an initial sample of 81 third grade children, along with the SCAN screening test for auditory processing disorders. Afterward, several exploratory factor analyses were performed on the findings, and comparisons were made between the results for the MAPA and SCAN. Four separate factors emerged from the four MAPA tests, which were linked closely to the components of central auditory processing disorders (CAPDs) defined by ASHA (1996, American Journal of Audiology, 5(2), 41-54). These factors were labeled monaural separation/closure (MSC), auditory pattern/temporal ordering, binaural integration, and binaural separation (BS). SCAN appears to measure two of these factors, MSC and BS. Use of MAPA is encouraging. Our findings suggest it may provide an appropriate multiple-test, CAPD battery for third grade children, and it meets at least some of the objectives described in the consensus document proposed by ASHA (1996, American Journal of Audiology, 5(2), 41-54).},

abstract = {Attending to a single stimulus in a complex multisensory environment requires the ability to select relevant information while ignoring distracting input. The underlying mechanism and involved neuronal levels of this attentional gain control are still a matter of debate. Here, we investigated the influence of intermodal attention on different levels of auditory processing in humans. It is known that the activity of the cochlear amplifier can be modulated by efferent neurons of the medial olivocochlear complex. We used distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements to monitor cochlear activity during an intermodal cueing paradigm. Simultaneously, central auditory processing was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) with a steady-state paradigm targeting early cortical responses and analysis of alpha oscillations reflecting higher cognitive control of attentional modulation. We found effects of selective attention at all measured levels of the auditory processing: DPOAE levels differed significantly between periods of visual and auditory attention, showing a reduction during visual attention, but no change during auditory attention. Primary auditory cortex activity, as measured by the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), differed between conditions, with higher ASSRs during auditory than visual attention. Furthermore, the analysis of cortical oscillatory activity revealed increased alpha power over occipitoparietal and frontal regions during auditory compared with visual attention, putatively reflecting suppression of visual processing. In conclusion, this study showed both enhanced processing of attended acoustic stimuli in early sensory cortex and reduced processing of distracting input, both at higher cortical levels and at the most peripheral level of the hearing system, the cochlea.},

abstract = {Type II cochlear afferents receive glutamatergic synaptic excitation from outer hair cells (OHCs) in the rat cochlea. However, it remains uncertain whether this connection is capable of providing auditory information to the brain. The functional efficacy of this connection depends in part on the number of presynaptic OHCs, their probability of transmitter release, and the effective electrical distance for spatial summation in the type II fiber. The present work addresses these questions using whole-cell recordings from the spiral process of type II afferents that run below OHCs in the apical turn of young (5-9 d postnatal) rat cochlea. A "high potassium puffer" was used to elicit calcium action potentials from individual OHCs and thereby show that the average probability of transmitter release was 0.26 (range 0.02-0.73). Electron microscopy showed relatively few vesicles tethered to ribbons in equivalent OHCs. A "receptive field" map for individual type II fibers was constructed by successively puffing onto OHCs along the cochlear spiral, up to 180 $\mu$m from the recording pipette. These revealed a conservative estimate of 7 presynaptic OHCs per type II fiber (range 1-11). EPSCs evoked from presynaptic OHCs separated by >100 $\mu$m did not differ in amplitude or waveform, implying that the type II fiber's length constant exceeded the length of the synaptic input zone. Together these data suggest that type II fibers could communicate centrally by maximal activation of their entire pool of presynaptic OHCs.},

abstract = {Sensorineural hearing loss, which stems primarily from the failure of mechanosensory hair cells, changes the traveling waves that transmit acoustic signals along the cochlea. However, the connection between cochlear mechanics and the amplificatory function of hair cells remains unclear. Using an optical technique that permits the targeted inactivation of prestin, a protein of outer hair cells that generates forces on the basilar membrane, we demonstrate that these forces interact locally with cochlear traveling waves to achieve enormous mechanical amplification. By perturbing amplification in narrow segments of the basilar membrane, we further show that a cochlear traveling wave accumulates gain as it approaches its peak. Analysis of these results indicates that cochlear amplification produces negative damping that counters the viscous drag impeding traveling waves; targeted photoinactivation locally interrupts this compensation. These results reveal the locus of amplification in cochlear traveling waves and connect the characteristics of normal hearing to molecular forces.},

Otoacoustic emissions can be used to determine any dysfunction of these cells. A set of clinical records was established to register the neurological and auditory functioning in 42 children, followed by assessment with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Initial Language Test (ILT), the Auditory and Phonetic Discrimination Evaluation (APDE), tests for measuring Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) and Transient Otoacoustic Emissions (TOAE). Subjects were classified into 3 groups in this study: Control (C; n = 20), Syntactic Phonological Disorder (SPD; n = 17), and those with Phonological Disability (PD; n = 5). BAEP studies showed a clear response when all children were stimulated to 20 dB. TOAE responses displayed clear and significant differences with half-octave band reproducibility for both ears, the largest effect being observed in the right ear. The results that were compared using ANOVA tests, showed that cochlear processing affects the brain language function, playing a critical role in the language phonetic process.},

abstract = {This paper examines what mechanisms underlie auditory perceptual learning. Fifteen normal hearing adults performed two-alternative, forced choice, pure tone frequency discrimination for four sessions. External variability was introduced by adding a zero-mean Gaussian random variable to the frequency of each tone. Measures of internal noise, encoding efficiency, bias, and inattentiveness were derived using four methods (model fit, classification boundary, psychometric function, and double-pass consistency). The four methods gave convergent estimates of internal noise, which was found to decrease from 4.52 to 2.93 Hz with practice. No group-mean changes in encoding efficiency, bias, or inattentiveness were observed. It is concluded that learned improvements in frequency discrimination primarily reflect a reduction in internal noise. Data from highly experienced listeners and neural networks performing the same task are also reported. These results also indicated that auditory learning represents internal noise reduction, potentially through the re-weighting of frequency-specific channels.},

abstract = {The present study examined cortical parallels to psychophysical signal detection and sound localization in the presence of background noise. The activity of single units or of small clusters of units was recorded in cortical area A2 of chloralose-anesthetized cats. Signals were 80-ms click trains that varied in location in the horizontal plane around the animal. Maskers were continuous broadband noises. In the focal masker condition, a single masker source was tested at various azimuths. In the diffuse masker condition, uncorrelated noise was presented from two speakers at +/-90 degrees lateral to the animal. For about 2/3 of units ("type A"), the presence of the masker generally reduced neural sensitivity to signals, and the effects of the masker depended on the relative locations of signal and masker sources. For the remaining 1/3 of units ("type B"), the masker reduced spike rates at low signal levels but often augmented spike rates at higher signal levels. Increases in spike rates of type B units were most common for signal sources in front of the ear contralateral to the recording site but tended to be independent of masker source location. For type A units, masker effects could be modeled as a shift toward higher levels of spike-rate- and spike-latency-versus-level functions. For a focal masker, the shift size decreased with increasing separation of signal and masker. That result resembled psychophysical spatial unmasking, i.e., improved signal detection by spatial separation of the signal from the noise source. For the diffuse masker condition, the shift size generally was constant across signal locations. For type A units, we examined the effects of maskers on cortical signaling of sound-source location, using an artificial-neural-network (ANN) algorithm. First, an ANN was trained to estimate the signal location in the quiet condition by recognizing the spike patterns of single units. Then we tested ANN responses for spike patterns recorded under various masker conditions. Addition of a masker generally altered spike patterns and disrupted ANN identification of signal location. That disruption was smaller, however, for signal and masker configurations in which the masker did not severely reduce units' spike rates. That result compared well with the psychophysical observation that listeners maintain good localization performance as long as signals are clearly audible.},

abstract = {Two experiments using the materials of the Revised Speech Perception in Noise (SPIN-R) Test [Bilger et al., J. Speech Hear. Res. 27, 32-48 (1984)] were conducted to investigate age-related differences in the identification and the recall of sentence-final words heard in a babble background. In experiment 1, the level of the babble was varied to determine psychometric functions (percent correct word identification as a function of S/N ratio) for presbycusics, old adults with near-normal hearing, and young normal-hearing adults, when the sentence-final words were either predictable (high context) or unpredictable (low context). Differences between the psychometric functions for high- and low-context conditions were used to show that both groups of old listeners derived more benefit from supportive context than did young listeners. In experiment 2, a working memory task [Daneman and Carpenter, J. Verb. Learn. Verb. Behav. 19, 450-466 (1980)] was added to the SPIN task for young and old adults. Specifically, after listening to and identifying the sentence-final words for a block of n sentences, the subjects were asked to recall the last n words that they had identified. Old subjects recalled fewer of the items they had perceived than did young subjects in all S/N conditions, even though there was no difference in the recall ability of the two age groups when sentences were read. Furthermore, the number of items recalled by both age groups was reduced in adverse S/N conditions. The resutls were interpreted as supporting a processing model in which reallocable processing resources are used to support auditory processing when listening becomes difficult either because of noise, or because of age-related deterioration in the auditory system. Because of this reallocation, these resources are unavailable to more central cognitive processes such as the storage and retrieval functions of working memory, so that "upstream" processing of auditory information is adversely affected.},

abstract = {The present study focuses on influences of long-term experience on auditory processing, providing the first evidence for pre-attentively superior auditory processing in musicians. This was revealed by the brain's automatic change-detection response, which is reflected electrically as the mismatch negativity (MMN) and generated by the operation of sensoric (echoic) memory, the earliest cognitive memory system. Major chords and single tones were presented to both professional violinists and non-musicians under ignore and attend conditions. Slightly impure chords, presented among perfect major chords elicited a distinct MMN in professional musicians, but not in non-musicians. This demonstrates that compared to non-musicians, musicians are superior in pre-attentively extracting more information out of musically relevant stimuli. Since effects of long-term experience on pre-attentive auditory processing have so far been reported for language-specific phonemes only, results indicate that sensory memory mechanisms can be modulated by training on a more general level.},

abstract = {Speech recognition was measured in three groups of listeners: those with sensorineural hearing loss of (presumably) cochlear origin (HL), those with normal hearing (NH), and those with normal hearing who listened in the presence of a spectrally shaped noise that elevated their pure-tone thresholds to match those of individual listeners in the HL group (NM). Performance was measured in four backgrounds that differed only in their temporal envelope: steady-state (SS) speech-shaped noise, speech-shaped noise modulated by the envelope of multi-talker babble (MT), speech-shaped noise modulated by the envelope of single-talker speech (ST), and speech-shaped noise modulated by a 10-Hz square wave (SQ). Threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were typically best in the ST and especially the SQ conditions, indicating a masking release in those modulated backgrounds. SNRs in the SS and MT conditions were essentially identical to one another. The masking release was largest in the listeners in the NH group, and it tended to decrease as hearing loss increased. In 5 of the 11 listeners in the HL group, the masking release was nearly identical to that obtained in the NM group matched to those listeners; in the other 6 listeners, the release was smaller than that in the NM group. The reduced masking release was simulated best in those HL listeners for whom the masking release was relatively large. These results suggest that reduced masking release for speech in listeners with sensorineural hearing loss can only sometimes be accounted for entirely by reduced audibility.},

However, the traditional method for determining PTCs takes too long for use in clinical practice. We evaluated a fast method for determining PTCs, using a band of noise that sweeps in centre frequency and a B{\'e}k{\'e}sy method to adjust the masker level required for threshold. The shapes of the PTCs were similar for the fast and traditional methods, for both normally hearing and hearing-impaired subjects. Rates of change of masker level of 2 dB/s or less gave the most reliable results. A relatively wide bandwidth (20 percent of the signal frequency or 320 Hz, whichever is the smaller) was needed to minimise the influence of beat detection. When the signal frequency fell within a dead region, the fast method gave PTCs with shifted tips.},

The present study demonstrated the existence of the DPOAE adaptation phenomenon in mice analogous to that previously reported in cats. The present data were fitted with one- or two-exponential functions. With a one-exponential fit in 2-month old mice, the adaptation magnitude ranged from 0 to 4 dB with the average value of 0.5 to 1.6 dB and the average time constant was 0.5 to 2.3 s. With a two-exponential fit, the shorter time constant was 0.3 to 1.7 s. The adaptation magnitude and time constant were similar between the monaural and binaural stimulations. We observed that there was a statistically significant decrease of adaptation magnitude in older CBA mice with age-related hearing loss when compared with young adult mice. The results from the young adult mice should be useful in future studies, e.g., a study of developmental changes in post-natal mice, or changes accompanying an alteration in the central auditory system arising from any etiology. We suggest that this phenomenon can be used as a tool for advancing basic knowledge of the auditory system and for assessing an impairment of the olivocochlear system, e.g., in aging.},

DESIGN:Listening effort was measured using a dual task paradigm. Participants repeated monosyllabic words presented in a background of children's chatter (primary task) at SNRs that are considered typical of the school classroom environment (quiet, +4, 0, -4 dB) while simultaneously rehearsing sets of five digits for recall (secondary task). High listening effort requires greater cognitive resources and is associated with reduced performance on the secondary task.

STUDY SAMPLE:Thirty one normal-hearing children (9-12 years).

RESULTS:Performance was generally maintained on the listening task when multitasking; however, performance decreased on the secondary recall task, especially at the more negative SNRs.

CONCLUSIONS:This demonstrates that considerable listening effort is required when listening at SNRs that are typical of the school classroom.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to investigate the relationship between the complaint of speech understanding in noisy environments and the findings of contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech recognition in noise test methods in individuals with normal hearing. METHODS: Sixty-nine subjects between 18 and 53 years of age with normal hearing participated in the present study. The subjects were assigned to one of two groups, reported difficulty understanding speech in noise or no reported difficulty understanding speech in noise. After hearing and immitancemetric evaluation, contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech recognition in noise tests were administered to both groups. Suppression was calculated in half-octave frequency bands centered at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0kHz. RESULTS: We found out that the speech recognition in noise scores and contralateral suppression values were lower in subjects with the complaint of speech understanding in noise than those who do not have such complaints. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the complaint of speech understanding in noise may be related to the medial efferent system dysfunction, so central auditory nervous system.},

The technique used was to record the TEOAE alternately with and without contralateral noise. The result was a reduction in TEOAE amplitude and latency. This was best illustrated with a difference waveform obtained from the subtraction of the TEOAE waveform recorded with contralateral noise, from the waveform recorded without contralateral noise. All the full term neonates and also the 6-week-old baby showed significant effects indicating functional maturity of the medial olivocochlear system.},

Here, we review recent evidence suggesting that a process of gain control, operating at multiple stages in the auditory pathway, helps maintain coding accuracy to prevailing sound conditions over a wide range of behavioural and sensory contexts. Together, these processes imbue the system with its staggering representational capacity, underpinning everything from the perception of a tiger's near-silent tread to its triumphant roar, demonstrating once more the principle of efficient coding that underlies sensory processing.},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions serve as a noninvasive probe of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. Stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) elicited by a low-level probe tone may be the optimal type of emission for studying MOC effects because at low levels, the probe itself does not elicit the MOC reflex [Guinan et al. (2003) J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 4:521]. Based on anatomical considerations, the MOC reflex activated by ipsilateral acoustic stimulation (mediated by the crossed olivocochlear bundle) is predicted to be stronger than the reflex to contralateral stimulation. Broadband noise is an effective activator of the MOC reflex; however, it is also an effective activator of the middle-ear muscle (MEM) reflex, which can make results difficult to interpret. The MEM reflex may be activated at lower levels than measured clinically, and most previous human studies have not explicitly included measurements to rule out MEM reflex contamination. The current study addressed these issues using a higher-frequency SFOAE probe tone to test for cochlear changes mediated by the MOC reflex, while simultaneously monitoring the MEM reflex using a low-frequency probe tone. Broadband notched noise was presented ipsilaterally at various levels to elicit probe-tone shifts. Measurements are reported for 15 normal-hearing subjects. With the higher-frequency probe near 1.5 kHz, only 20% of subjects showed shifts consistent with an MOC reflex in the absence of an MEM-induced shift. With the higher-frequency probe near 3.5 kHz, up to 40% of subjects showed shifts in the absence of an MEM-induced shift. However, these responses had longer time courses than expected for MOC-induced shifts, and may have been dominated by other cochlear processes, rather than MOC reflex. These results suggest caution in the interpretation of effects observed using ipsilaterally presented acoustic activators intended to excite the MOC reflex.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:This study investigates the ability to understand degraded speech signals and explores the correlation between this capacity and the functional characteristics of the peripheral auditory system.

METHOD:The authors evaluated the capability of 50 normal-hearing native French speakers to restore time-reversed speech. The task required them to transcribe two-syllable items containing temporal reversions of variable sizes, ranging from no reversion to complete reversion, increasing by half-syllable steps. In parallel, the functionality of each participant's auditory efferent system was evaluated using contralateral suppression of click-evoked otoacoustic emissions.

RESULTS:Perceptual accuracy for time-reversed speech diminished when the size of the applied temporal distortion increased. A lexical benefit was evident, and an important interindividual variability in performance was observed. Functional exploration of the auditory system revealed that speech restoration performances correlated with the suppression strength of the participant's auditory efferent system.

CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest a clear relation between the functional asymmetry of the auditory efferent pathway (the right-side activity is greater than the left-side activity in right-handed participants) and the comprehension of acoustically distorted speech in normal-hearing participants. Further experiments are needed to better specify how the functionality of the medial olivocochlear bundle can cause phonological activation to be more efficient.},

abstract = {Auditory filter bandwidths and time constants were obtained with five normal-hearing subjects for different masker configurations both in the frequency and time domain for monaural and binaural listening conditions. Specifically, the masking level in the monaural condition and the interaural correlation in the binaural conditions, respectively, was changed in a sinusoidal, stepwise, and rectangular way in the frequency domain. In the corresponding experiments in the time domain, a sinusoidal and stepwise change of the masker was performed. From these results, a comparison was made across conditions to evaluate the influence of the factors "shape of transition," "monaural versus binaural," "frequency domain versus time domain," and "subject." Also, the respective data from the literature were considered using the same model assumptions and fitting strategy as used for the current data. The results indicate that the monaural auditory filter bandwidths and time constants fitted to the data are consistent across conditions both for the data included in this study and the data from the literature. No consistent relation between individual auditory filter bandwidths and time constants were found across subjects. For the binaural conditions, however, considerable differences were found in estimates of the bandwidths and time constants, respectively, across conditions. The reason for this mismatch seems to be the different detection strategies employed for the various tasks that are affected by the consistency of binaural information across frequency and time. While monaural detection performance appears to be modeled quite well with a linear filter or temporal integration window, this does not hold for the binaural conditions where both larger bandwidth and time constant estimates are found.},

abstract = {Auditory filter shapes were derived from psychophysical measurements in eight normal-hearing listeners using a variant of the notched-noise method for brief signals in forward and simultaneous masking. Signal frequencies of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 kHz were tested. The signal level was fixed at 10 dB above absolute threshold in the forward-masking conditions and fixed at either 10 or 35 dB above absolute threshold in the simultaneous-masking conditions. The results show that filter equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs) are substantially narrower in forward masking than has been found in previous studies using simultaneous masking. Furthermore, in contrast to earlier studies, the sharpness of tuning doubles over the range of frequencies tested, giving Q(ERB) values of about 10 and 20 at signal frequencies of 1 and 8 kHz, respectively. It is argued that the new estimates of auditory filter bandwidth provide a more accurate estimate of human cochlear tuning at low levels than earlier estimates using simultaneous masking at higher levels, and that they are therefore more suitable for comparison to cochlear tuning data from other species. The data may also prove helpful in defining the parameters for nonlinear models of human cochlear processing.},

abstract = {Children with reading impairments have deficits in phonological awareness, phonemic categorization, speech-in-noise perception, and psychophysical tasks such as frequency and temporal discrimination. Many of these children also exhibit abnormal encoding of speech stimuli in the auditory brainstem, even though responses to click stimuli are normal. In typically developing children the auditory brainstem response reflects acoustic differences between contrastive stop consonants. The current study investigated whether this subcortical differentiation of stop consonants was related to reading ability and speech-in-noise performance. Across a group of children with a wide range of reading ability, the subcortical differentiation of 3 speech stimuli ([ba], [da], [ga]) was found to be correlated with phonological awareness, reading, and speech-in-noise perception, with better performers exhibiting greater differences among responses to the 3 syllables. When subjects were categorized into terciles based on phonological awareness and speech-in-noise performance, the top-performing third in each grouping had greater subcortical differentiation than the bottom third. These results are consistent with the view that the neural processes underlying phonological awareness and speech-in-noise perception depend on reciprocal interactions between cognitive and perceptual processes.},

abstract = {Evoked potentials are usually evaluated subjectively, by visual inspection, and considerable differences between interpretations can occur. Objective, automated methods are normally based on calculating one (or more) parameters from the data, but only some of these techniques can provide statistical significance (p-values) for the presence of a response. In this work, we propose a bootstrap technique to provide such p-values, which can be applied to a wide variety of parameters. The bootstrap method is based on randomly resampling (with replacement) the original data and gives an estimate of the probability that the response obtained is due to random variation in the data rather than a physiological response. The method is illustrated using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to detecting hearing thresholds. The flexibility of the approach is illustrated, showing how it can be used with different parameters, numbers of stimuli and with user-defined false-positive rates. The bootstrap method provides a new, simple and yet powerful means of detecting evoked potentials, which is very flexible and readily adapted to a wide variety of signal parameters.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The purpose of the present study was to investigate the value of a new gap detection procedure called Gaps-In-Noise (GIN) for assessment of temporal resolution in a clinical population.

DESIGN:The test consists of 0 to 3 silent intervals ranging from 2 to 20 msec embedded in 6-sec segments of white noise. The location, number, and duration of the gaps per noise segment vary throughout the test for a total of 60 gaps presented in each of four lists. The GIN procedure was administered to 50 normal-hearing listeners (group I) and 18 subjects with confirmed neurological involvement of the central auditory nervous system (group II).

RESULTS:Results showed mean approximated gap detection thresholds of 4.8 msec for the left ear and 4.9 msec for the right ear for group I. In comparison, results for group II demonstrated a statistically significant increase in gap detection thresholds, with approximated thresholds of 7.8 msec and 8.5 msec being noted for the left and right ears, respectively. Significant mean differences were also observed in the overall performance scores (i.e., the identification of the presence of the gaps within the noise segments) of the two groups of subjects. Finally, psychometric functions, although similar for short and long duration gaps, were highly different for gaps in the 4- to 10-msec range for the two groups.

CONCLUSIONS:A variety of psychoacoustic procedures are available to assess temporal resolution; however, the clinical use of these procedures is minimal at best. Results of the present study show that the GIN test holds promise as a clinically useful tool in the assessment of temporal resolution in the clinical arena.},

abstract = {We have described three major groupings that encompass most auditory processing difficulties. While the problems may be superimposed upon one another in any individual client, each diagnostic sign is closely associated with particular communication and learning disorders. In addition, these behaviors may be related back to the functional anatomy of the regions that are implicated by the SSW test. The auditory-decoding group is deficient in rapid analysis of speech. The vagueness of speech sound knowledge is thought to lead to auditory misunderstanding and confusion. In early life, this may be reflected in the child's articulation. Poor phonic skills that result from this deficit are thought to contribute to their limited reading and spelling abilities. The auditory tolerance-fading memory group is often thought to have severe auditory-processing problems because those in it are highly distracted by background sounds and have poor auditory memories. However, school performance is not far from grade level, and the resulting reading disabilities stem more from limited comprehension than from an inability to sound out the words. Distractibility and poor auditory memory could contribute to the apparent weakness in reading comprehension. Many of the characteristics of the auditory tolerance-fading memory group are similar to those of attention deficit disorder cases. Both groups are associated anatomically with the AC region. The auditory integration cases can be divided into two subgroups. In the first, the subjects exhibit the most severe reading and spelling problems of the three major categories. These individuals closely resemble the classical dyslexics. We presume that this disorder represents a major disruption in auditory-visual integration. The second subgroup has much less severe learning difficulties, which closely follow the pattern of dysfunction of the auditory tolerance-fading memory group. The excellent physiological procedures to which we have been exposed during this Windows on the Brain conference provide a glimpse of the exciting possibilities for studying brain function. However, in working with individuals who have cognitive impairments, the new technology should be validated by standard behavioral tests. In turn, the new techniques will provide those who use behavioral measures with new parameters and concepts to broaden our understanding. For the past quarter of a century, the SSW test has been compared with other behavioral, physiological, and anatomical procedures. Based on the information that has been assembled, we have been able to classify auditory processing disorders into three major categories.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) of all types are widely assumed to arise by a common mechanism: nonlinear electromechanical distortion within the cochlea. In this view, both stimulus-frequency (SFOAEs) and distortion-product emissions (DPOAEs) arise because nonlinearities in the mechanics act as "sources" of backward-traveling waves. This unified picture is tested by analyzing measurements of emission phase using a simple phenomenological description of the nonlinear re-emission process. The analysis framework is independent of the detailed form of the emission sources and the nonlinearities that produce them. The analysis demonstrates that the common assumption that SFOAEs originate by nonlinear distortion requires that SFOAE phase be essentially independent of frequency, in striking contradiction with experiment. This contradiction implies that evoked otoacoustic emissions arise by two fundamentally different mechanisms within the cochlea. These two mechanisms (linear reflection versus nonlinear distortion) are described and two broad classes of emissions--reflection-source and distortion-source emissions--are distinguished based on the mechanisms of their generation. The implications of this OAE taxonomy for the measurement, interpretation, and clinical use of otoacoustic emissions as noninvasive probes of cochlear function are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:1) To describe distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels, noise levels and signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for a wide range of frequencies and two stimulus levels in neonates and infants. 2) To describe the relations between these DPOAE measurements and age, test environment, baby state, and test time.

DESIGN:DPOAEs were measured in 2348 well babies without risk indicators, 353 well babies with at least one risk indicator, and 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). DPOAE and noise levels were measured at f2 frequencies of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz, and for primary levels (L1/L2) of 65/50 dB SPL and 75/75 dB SPL. Measurement-based stopping rules were used such that a test did not terminate unless the response was at least 3 dB above the mean noise floor + 2 SDs (SNR) for at least four of five test frequencies. The test would terminate, however, if these criteria were not met after 360 sec. Baby state, test environment, and other test factors were captured at the time of each test.

RESULTS:DPOAE levels, noise levels and SNRs were similar for well babies without risk indicators, well babies with risk indicators, and NICU graduates. There was a tendency for larger responses at f2 frequencies of 1.5 and 2.0 Hz, compared with 3.0 and 4.0 kHz; however, the noise levels systematically decreased as frequency increased, resulting in the most favorable SNRs at 3.0 and 4.0 kHz. Response levels were least and noise levels highest for an f2 frequency of 1.0 kHz. In addition, test time to achieve automatic stopping criteria was greatest for 1.0 kHz. With the exception of "active/alert" and "crying" babies, baby state had little influence on DPOAE measurements. Additionally, test environment had little impact on these measurements, at least for the environments in which babies were tested in this study. However, the lowest SNRs were observed for infants who were tested in functioning isolettes. Finally, there were some subtle age affects on DPOAE levels, with the infants born most prematurely producing the smallest responses, regardless of age at the time of test.

CONCLUSIONS:DPOAE measurements in neonates and infants result in robust responses in the vast majority of ears for f2 frequencies of at least 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 kHz. SNRs decrease as frequency decreases, making the measurements less reliable at 1.0 kHz. When considered along with test time, there may be little justification for including an f2 frequency at 1.0 kHz in newborn screening programs. It would appear that DPOAEs result in reliable measurements when tests are conducted in the environments in which babies typically are found. Finally, these data suggest that babies can be tested in those states of arousal that are most commonly encountered in the perinatal period.},

abstract = {We present here two patients and three control subjects to demonstrate the clinical utility of studying evoked otoacoustic emissions and their contralateral suppression, as an aid to the delineation of afferent neuron dysfunction and possible lack of efferent suppression. The key patients here who fail to show contralateral suppression of their very robust otoacoustic emissions, concomitantly show paradoxically absent auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and absence of middle ear muscle reflexes despite normal audiograms in the 2 kHz region and normal tympanograms. One of these patients has nearly normal pure tone sensitivity up to 3 kHz. The other has normal sensitivity in the 2 kHz region, but poor sensitivity on either side of that frequency. In addition, the two patients of interest show absent masking level differences and inordinately poor speech discrimination. Three 'foils' are presented: one patient with poor hearing on either side of 2 kHz, one with Bell's Palsy, and the third with bilateral temporal lobe disease. These patients show respectively that (1) isolated normal hearing at 2 kHz, (2) absence of middle ear muscle reflexes and (3) conscious cortical awareness of sound do not contribute directly to this intriguing clinical state. We propose that these patients with absent ABRs suffer from an auditory nervous system dysfunction which disrupts access to the efferent system. This condition also disables whatever systems contribute to the neural synchrony inherent in recording compound far-field action potentials such as the ABR. There are a number of hypotheses to be considered here. One suggests that the key patients are deficient in synchronous activation of Type I afferent fibers to the degree that they cannot activate efferent feedback, or they may be able to use only so-called Type II afferent neurons to support their normal zones of pure tone sensitivity. A less likely consideration focuses on the notion that discharge of primary neurons might be in some way synchronized by an efferent system which in these patients is the primary source of deficit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To assess the sensitivity of two bilateral cochlear implant users to interaural level and time differences (ILDs and ITDs) for various signals presented through the auxiliary inputs of clinical sound processors that discard fine timing information and only preserve envelope cues.

DESIGN:In a lateralization discrimination experiment, the just noticeable difference (JND) for ILDs and envelope ITDs was measured by means of an adaptive 2-AFC method. Different stimuli were used, including click trains at varying repetition rates, a speech fragment, and noise bursts. For one cochlear implant listener and one stimulus, the sensitivity to envelope ITDs was also determined with the method of constant stimuli. The dependency of ILD-JNDs on the interaural place difference was studied with stimulation at single electrode pairs by using sinusoidal input signals in combination with appropriate single-channel processor fittings. In a lateralization position experiment, subjects were required to use a visual pointer on a computer screen to indicate in-the-head positions for blocks of stimuli containing either ILD or ITD cues. All stimuli were loudness balanced (before applying ILD) and fed directly into the auxiliary inputs of the BTE processors (TEMPO+, Med-El Corp.). The automatic gain control and the processors' microphones were deactivated.

RESULTS:Both cochlear implant listeners were highly sensitive to ILDs in all broadband stimuli used; JNDs approached those of normal-hearing listeners. Pitch-matched single electrode pairs showed significantly lower ILD-JNDs than pitch-mismatched electrode pairs. Envelope ITD-JNDs of cochlear implant listeners obtained with the adaptive method were substantially higher and showed a higher test-retest variability than waveform ITD-JNDs of normal-hearing control listeners and envelope ITD-JNDs of normal-hearing listeners reported in the literature for comparable signals. The envelope ITD-JNDs for the click trains were significantly lower than for the speech token or the noise bursts. The best envelope ITD-JND measured was ca. 250 mus for the click train at 100 cycles per sec. Direct measurement of the psychometric function for envelope ITD by the method of constant stimuli showed discrimination above chance level down to 150 micros. The lateralization position experiment showed that both ILDs and envelope ITDs can lead to monotonic changes in lateral percept.

CONCLUSIONS:The two cochlear implant users tested showed strong effects of ILDs in various broadband stimuli with respect to JNDs as well as lateralization position. The high dependency of ILD-JNDs on the interaural pitch difference suggests the potential importance of pitch-matched assignment of electrodes in the two ears by the speech processors. Envelope ITDs appear to be more ambiguous cues than ILDs, as reflected by the higher and more variable JNDs compared with normal-hearing listeners. The envelope ITD-JNDs of cochlear implant listeners depended on the stimulus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Our purpose was to identify infants with a bilateral, permanent, handicapping hearing loss and to provide them with amplification before age 6 months.

METHODOLOGY:The study population consisted of 10,372 infants born during a 5-year period. Universal hearing screening by automated auditory brainstem response was done in the nursery. Infants who failed the screening test were followed up diagnostically. Infants who were not tested in the nursery were followed up as outpatients. Hearing aids were recommended for those infants who had bilateral hearing loss.

RESULTS:Successful screening in the nursery was achieved for 96% of infants. The failure rate was 4%. The incidence of bilateral loss requiring amplification was 1.4/1000. The false-positive rate was 3.5% after the initial screening and .2% when a two-stage screening procedure was used. The incidence of congenital bilateral hearing loss in the well population was 1/1000, and in the neonatal intensive care unit population, 5/1000. The cost of screening was $17 per infant, and the cost to identify each true bilateral hearing loss was $17,750. Amplification was recommended for 15 infants; well infants who used hearing aids before age 6 months achieved age-appropriate speech and language development.

CONCLUSIONS:Mild, moderate, and severe bilateral, persistent hearing loss can be identified in the nursery by automated auditory brainstem response measurement to provide amplification before age 6 months and thus optimize speech and language development.},

abstract = {The inner ear receives two types of efferent feedback from the brainstem: one pathway provides gain control on outer hair cells' contribution to cochlear amplification, and the other modulates the excitability of the cochlear nerve. Although efferent feedback can protect hair cells from acoustic injury and thereby minimize noise-induced permanent threshold shifts, most prior studies focused on high-intensity exposures (>100 dB SPL). Here, we show that efferents are essential for long-term maintenance of cochlear function in mice aged 1 year post-de-efferentation without purposeful acoustic overexposure. Cochlear de-efferentation was achieved by surgical lesion of efferent pathways in the brainstem and was assessed by quantitative analysis of immunostained efferent terminals in outer and inner hair cell areas. The resultant loss of efferent feedback accelerated the age-related amplitude reduction in cochlear neural responses, as seen in auditory brainstem responses, and increased the loss of synapses between hair cells and the terminals of cochlear nerve fibers, as seen in confocal analysis of the organ of Corti immunostained for presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. This type of neuropathy, also seen after moderate noise exposure, has been termed "hidden hearing loss", because it does not affect thresholds, but can be seen in the suprathreshold amplitudes of cochlear neural responses, and likely causes problems with hearing in a noisy environment, a classic symptom of age-related hearing loss in humans. Since efferent reflex strength varies among individuals and can be measured noninvasively, a weak reflex may be an important risk factor, and prognostic indicator, for age-related hearing impairment.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to localize the intracerebral generators for auditory steady-state responses. The stimulus was a continuous 1000-Hz tone presented to the right or left ear at 70 dBSPL. The tone was sinusoidally amplitude-modulated to a depth of 100% at 12, 39, or 88 Hz. Responses recorded from 47 electrodes on the head were transformed into the frequency domain. Brain electrical source analysis treated the real and imaginary components of the response in the frequency domain as independent samples. The latency of the source activity was estimated from the phase of the source waveform. The main source model contained a midline brainstem generator with two components (one vertical and lateral) and cortical sources in the left and right supratemporal plane, each containing tangential and radial components. At 88 Hz, the largest activity occurred in the brainstem and subsequent cortical activity was minor. At 39 Hz, the initial brainstem component remained and significant activity also occurred in the cortical sources, with the tangential activity being larger than the radial. The 12-Hz responses were small, but suggested combined activation of both brainstem and cortical sources. Estimated latencies decreased for all source waveforms as modulation frequency increased and were shorter for the brainstem compared to cortical sources. These results suggest that the whole auditory nervous system is activated by modulated tones, with the cortex being more sensitive to slower modulation frequencies.},

abstract = {The auditory space map in the optic tectum (OT) (also known as superior colliculus in mammals) relies on the tuning of neurons to auditory localization cues that correspond to specific sound source locations. This study investigates the effects of early auditory experiences on the neural representation of binaural auditory localization cues. Young barn owls were raised in continuous omnidirectional broadband noise from before hearing onset to the age of ∼ 65 days. Data from these birds were compared with data from age-matched control owls and from normal adult owls (>200 days). In noise-reared owls, the tuning of tectal neurons for interaural level differences and interaural time differences was broader than in control owls. Moreover, in neurons from noise-reared owls, the interaural level differences tuning was biased towards sounds louder in the contralateral ear. A similar bias appeared, but to a much lesser extent, in age-matched control owls and was absent in adult owls. To follow the recovery process from noise exposure, we continued to survey the neural representations in the OT for an extended period of up to several months after removal of the noise. We report that all the noise-rearing effects tended to recover gradually following exposure to a normal acoustic environment. The results suggest that deprivation from experiencing normal acoustic localization cues disrupts the maturation of the auditory space map in the OT.},

abstract = {Research reported during the past few decades has revealed the importance for human sound localization of the so-called "monaural spectral cues." These cues are the result of the direction-dependent filtering of incoming sound waves accomplished by the pinnae. One point of view about how these cues are extracted places great emphasis on the spectrum of the received sound at each ear individually. This leads to the suggestion that an effective way of studying the influence of these cues is to measure the ability of listeners to localize sounds when one of their ears is plugged. Numerous studies have appeared using this monaural localization paradigm. Three experiments are described here which are intended to clarify the results of the previous monaural localization studies and provide new data on how monaural spectral cues might be processed. Virtual sound sources are used in the experiments in order to manipulate and control the stimuli independently at the two ears. Two of the experiments deal with the consequences of the incomplete monauralization that may have contaminated previous work. The results suggest that even very low sound levels in the occluded ear provide access to interaural localization cues. The presence of these cues complicates the interpretation of the results of nominally monaural localization studies. The third experiment concerns the role of prior knowledge of the source spectrum, which is required if monaural cues are to be useful. The results of this last experiment demonstrate that extraction of monaural spectral cues can be severely disrupted by trial-to-trial fluctuations in the source spectrum. The general conclusion of the experiments is that, while monaural spectral cues are important, the monaural localization paradigm may not be the most appropriate way to study their role.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:One purported role of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system is to reduce the effects of masking noise. MOC system functioning can be evaluated noninvasively in humans through contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions. It has been suggested that the strength of the MOC efferent activity should be positively associated with listening performance in noise.

PURPOSE:The objective of the study was to further explore this notion by examining contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and sentence recognition in two noises with normal hearing young adults.

RESEARCH DESIGN:A repeated measures multivariate quasi-experimental design was employed. Study Sample: Thirty-two normal hearing young adult females participated.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Reception thresholds for sentences (RTSs) were determined monaurally and binaurally in quiet and in competing continuous and interrupted noises. Both noises had an identical power spectrum and differed only in their temporal continuity. "Release from masking" was computed by subtracting RTS signal-to-noise ratios in interrupted from continuous noise. TEOAEs were evoked with 80 dB peSPL click stimuli. To examine contralateral suppression, TEOAEs were evaluated with 60 dB peSPL click stimuli with and without a contralateral 65 dB SPL white noise suppressor.

RESULTS:A binaural advantage was observed for RTSs in quiet and noise (p < .0001) while there was no difference between ears (p >.05). In noise, performance was superior in the interrupted noise (i.e., RTSs were lower vs. continuous noise; p < .0001). There were no statistically significant differences in TEOAE levels between ears (p >.05). There was also no significant difference in the amount of suppression between ears (p = .41). There were no significant correlations or predictive linear relations between the amount of TEOAE suppression and any indices of sentence recognition in noise (i.e., RTS signal-to-noise ratios and release from masking; p > .05).

CONCLUSIONS:The findings are not consistent with the notion that increased medial olivocochlear efferent feedback, as assessed via contralateral suppression of TEOAEs, is associated with improved speech perception in continuous and interrupted noise.},

abstract = {Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded from eight developmental dyslexic adults with persistent reading, spelling and phonological deficits, and 10 non-dyslexic controls to voiced (/ba/) and voiceless (/pa/) consonant-vowel syllables. Consistent with previous data, non-dyslexics coded these stimuli differentially according to the temporal cues that form the basis of the voiced/voiceless contrast: AEPs had time-locked components with latencies that were determined by the temporal structure of the stimuli. Dyslexics were characterized by one of two electrophysiological patterns: AEP pattern I dyslexics demonstrated a differential coding of stimuli on the basis of some temporal cues, but with an atypically large number of components and a considerable delay in AEP termination time; AEP pattern II dyslexics demonstrated no clear differential coding of stimuli on the basis of temporal cues. These data reveal the presence of anomalies in cortical auditory processing which could underlie persistent perceptual and linguistic impairments in some developmental dyslexics. Furthermore, scalp AEP distribution maps showing the difference observed between /ba/ and /pa/ activity over time suggest that the regions implicated in the processing of crucial time-related acoustic cues were not systematically lateralized to the left hemisphere like they were for non-dyslexics. These findings may be conducive to a better understanding and treatment of perceptual dysfunctions in developmental language disorders.},

abstract = {Amplitude modulation (AM) is a temporal feature of most natural acoustic signals. A long psychophysical tradition has shown that AM is important in a variety of perceptual tasks, over a range of time scales. Technical possibilities in stimulus synthesis have reinvigorated this field and brought the modulation dimension back into focus. We address the question whether specialized neural mechanisms exist to extract AM information, and thus whether consideration of the modulation domain is essential in understanding the neural architecture of the auditory system. The available evidence suggests that this is the case. Peripheral neural structures not only transmit envelope information in the form of neural activity synchronized to the modulation waveform but are often tuned so that they only respond over a limited range of modulation frequencies. Ascending the auditory neuraxis, AM tuning persists but increasingly takes the form of tuning in average firing rate, rather than synchronization, to modulation frequency. There is a decrease in the highest modulation frequencies that influence the neural response, either in average rate or synchronization, as one records at higher and higher levels along the neuraxis. In parallel, there is an increasing tolerance of modulation tuning for other stimulus parameters such as sound pressure level, modulation depth, and type of carrier. At several anatomical levels, consideration of modulation response properties assists the prediction of neural responses to complex natural stimuli. Finally, some evidence exists for a topographic ordering of neurons according to modulation tuning. The picture that emerges is that temporal modulations are a critical stimulus attribute that assists us in the detection, discrimination, identification, parsing, and localization of acoustic sources and that this wide-ranging role is reflected in dedicated physiological properties at different anatomical levels.},

abstract = {In previous studies describing the effects of electrically stimulating the olivocochlear bundle, it seems possible that both medial and lateral (MOC and LOC) efferents may have been stimulated. To selectively stimulate MOC efferents, we used an electrode placed at the origin of the MOC efferents in the brainstem (MOC stimulation). For comparison, a stimulating electrode was placed in the fourth ventricle at the decussation of the crossed olivocochlear bundle where both MOC and LOC efferents are present (midline-OCB stimulation). Rate versus sound level functions from auditory-nerve fibers were obtained with and without efferent stimulation. Stimulation at either location shifted rate vs. level functions to higher sound levels and depressed the rate in the plateau. For fibers with high spontaneous rates, the level shifts and plateau depressions had slightly different distributions as a function of characteristic frequency. The average amplitudes of these effects were largest for midline-OCB stimulation, next largest for crossed MOC stimulation and smallest for uncrossed MOC stimulation. The qualitative pattern of the effects, however, did not depend on the location of the stimulus electrode. The amplitudes of the efferent-induced effects were different for auditory-nerve fibers with different spontaneous rates (by as much as a factor of three for the plateau depression). The results support several hypotheses: (1) the effects of midline-OCB stimulation are due only to the action of MOC efferents, (2) individual crossed and uncrossed MOC fibers produce similar effects, and (3) efferents differentially change the information carrying properties of auditory-nerve fibers in different spontaneous-rate categories. These results, taken together with anatomical data in the literature, are consistent with the hypothesis that, in the cat, MOC and midline-OCB stimulation have their effect solely through synapses on outer hair cells. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the level shifts are produced by MOC efferents acting on outer hair cells to reduce the mechanical stimulus to inner hair cells. It seems likely that some other mechanism is required to produce the plateau depressions, at least for auditory-nerve fibers with high spontaneous rates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of sentence intelligibility on the pupil dilation response during listening. Task-induced pupil-dilation reflects explicit effortful processing load. Therefore, pupillometry can be used to examine the listening effort during speech perception in difficult listening conditions. We expected to find increasing pupil dilation as a function of decreasing speech intelligibility.

DESIGN:Thirty-eight young participants (mean age = 23 yrs, SD = 3.2 yrs) with normal hearing were included. They performed three speech reception threshold (SRT) tests in which they listened to sentences in stationary noise. A one-up-one-down, two-up-one-down, or four-up-one-down adaptive procedure was applied, resulting in the correct rehearsal of 50, 71, or 84% of the sentences (SRT(50%), SRT(71%), and SRT(84%), respectively). We examined the peak dilation amplitude, the latency of the peak dilation amplitude, and the mean pupil dilation during the processing of the speech in each of these conditions. The peak dilation amplitude and mean pupil dilation were calculated relative to the baseline pupil diameter during listening to noise alone. For each SRT condition, participants rated the experienced listening effort and estimated their performance level.

RESULTS:The signal to noise ratios (SNRs) in the SRT(50%), SRT(71%), and SRT(84%) conditions increased as a function of the speech intelligibility level. The subjective effort ratings decreased, and the estimated performance increased with increasing speech intelligibility level. Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that peak dilation amplitude and mean pupil dilation were higher in the SRT(50%) condition as compared with the SRT(71%) and SRT(84%) conditions. The peak dilation amplitude, mean pupil dilation, and peak latency increased with decreasing SNR of the speech in noise, but no effect of noise level by itself on the baseline pupil diameter was observed. Irrespective of SNR, the pupil response was higher for incorrectly repeated sentences than for correctly repeated sentences. The analyses also indicated condition-order effects on the peak dilation amplitude and mean pupil dilatation: the pupil response was higher in the first SRT test than in the second and third tests. Within the first and third test, the baseline pupil diameter and the mean pupil dilation decreased as a function of the sentence number within the test. Spearman correlation coefficients showed no relations among the SNRs at the SRTs, subjective ratings, and the pupil response.

CONCLUSIONS:The peak dilation amplitude, peak latency, and mean pupil dilation systematically increase with decreasing speech intelligibility. These results support that listening effort, as indicated by the pupil response, increases with decreasing speech intelligibility. This study indicates that pupillometry can be used to examine how listeners reach a certain performance level. Application of this technique to study listening effort can yield valuable insight into the processing resources required across listening conditions and into the factors related to interindividual differences in speech perception in noise.},

abstract = {Auditory processing disorder (APD) is defined as a processing deficit in the auditory modality and spans multiple processes. To date, APD diagnosis is mostly based on the utilization of speech material. Adequate nonspeech tests that allow differentiation between an actual central hearing disorder and related disorders such as specific language impairments are still not adequately available. In the present study, 84 children between 6 and 17~years of age (clinical group), referred to three audiological centers for APD diagnosis, were evaluated with standard audiological tests and additional auditory discrimination tests. Latter tests assessed the processing of basic acoustic features at two different stages of the ascending central auditory system: (1) auditory brainstem processing was evaluated by quantifying interaural frequency, level, and signal duration discrimination (interaural tests). (2) Diencephalic/telencephalic processing was assessed by varying the same acoustic parameters (plus signals with sinusoidal amplitude modulation), but presenting the test signals in conjunction with noise pulses to the contralateral ear (dichoticsignal/noise tests). Data of children in the clinical group were referenced to normative data obtained from more than 300 normally developing healthy school children. The results in the audiological and the discrimination tests diverged widely. Of the 39 children that were diagnosed with APD in the audiological clinic, 30 had deficits in auditory performance. Even more alarming was the fact that of the 45 children with a negative APD diagnosis, 32 showed clear signs of a central hearing deficit. Based on these results, we suggest revising current diagnostic procedure to evaluate APD in order to more clearly differentiate between central auditory processing deficits and higher-order (cognitive and/or language) processing deficits.},

Children who performed above the median on the temporal resolution task in infancy were subsequently reported to have larger productive vocabularies, greater numbers of irregular word forms, and longer and more complex sentences than those who had performed below the median.

AIMS:To familiarize readers with current controversies surrounding APD, with an emphasis on how APD might be conceptualized in relation to language and reading problems, attentional problems and autistic spectrum disorders.

METHODS {\&} PROCEDURES:Different conceptual and diagnostic approaches adopted by audiologists and psychologists can lead to a confusing picture whereby the child who is regarded as having a specific learning disability by one group of experts may be given an APD diagnosis by another. While this could be indicative of co-morbidity, there are concerns that different professional groups are using different labels for the same symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS {\&} IMPLICATIONS:APD, as currently diagnosed, is not a coherent category, but that rather than abandoning the construct, we need to develop improved methods for assessment and diagnosis, with a focus on interdisciplinary evaluation.},

abstract = {Classic parametric statistical significance tests, such as analysis of variance and least squares regression, are widely used by researchers in many disciplines, including psychology. For classic parametric tests to produce accurate results, the assumptions underlying them (e.g., normality and homoscedasticity) must be satisfied. These assumptions are rarely met when analyzing real data. The use of classic parametric methods with violated assumptions can result in the inaccurate computation of p values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals. This may lead to substantive errors in the interpretation of data. Many modern robust statistical methods alleviate the problems inherent in using parametric methods with violated assumptions, yet modern methods are rarely used by researchers. The authors examine why this is the case, arguing that most researchers are unaware of the serious limitations of classic methods and are unfamiliar with modern alternatives. A range of modern robust and rank-based significance tests suitable for analyzing a wide range of designs is introduced. Practical advice on conducting modern analyses using software such as SPSS, SAS, and R is provided. The authors conclude by discussing robust effect size indices.},

abstract = {Sentences were processed through simulations of cochlear-implant signal processors with 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 channels and were presented to normal-hearing listeners at +2 db S/N and at -2 db S/N. The signal-processing operations included bandpass filtering, rectification, and smoothing of the signal in each band, estimation of the rms energy of the signal in each band (computed every 4 ms), and generation of sinusoids with frequencies equal to the center frequencies of the bands and amplitudes equal to the rms levels in each band. The sinusoids were summed and presented to listeners for identification. At issue was the number of channels necessary to reach maximum performance on tests of sentence understanding. At +2 dB S/N, the performance maximum was reached with 12 channels of stimulation. At -2 dB S/N, the performance maximum was reached with 20 channels of stimulation. These results, in combination with the outcome that in quiet, asymptotic performance is reached with five channels of stimulation, demonstrate that more channels are needed in noise than in quiet to reach a high level of sentence understanding and that, as the S/N becomes poorer, more channels are needed to achieve a given level of performance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:This article describes the audiologic findings and medical status of infants who were found to have hearing loss, detected as part of the Identification of Neonatal Hearing Impairment (INHI) project. In addition, the neonatal and maternal health variables for the group of infants who could not be tested with visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) due to developmental and visual disability are presented.

DESIGN:The overall goal of the INHI project was to evaluate the test performance of auditory brain stem response and evoked otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests given in the newborn period. These tools were evaluated on the basis of the infants' hearing when tested behaviorally with VRA at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. The neonatal test results, VRA results, medical history information and a record of intercurrent events occurring between the neonatal period and the time of VRA were collated and reviewed. The purpose of this article is to review the characteristics of those infants who were found to have hearing loss.

RESULTS:Of 2995 infants who had VRA tests judged to be of good or fair reliability, 168 had a finding of hearing loss for at least one ear, an incidence of 5.6%. Sixty-six infants had bilateral losses, an incidence of 2%, and 22 infants had bilateral hearing losses in the moderate to profound range, an incidence 0.7%. The prevalence of middle ear problems was greater than 50% among these infants with hearing loss. From the larger group of 168 infants with hearing loss, a group of 56 infants (86 ears) was chosen as those with a low probability that the hearing loss was due to transient middle ear pathology and was more likely hearing loss of a permanent nature. These were the infants used for the analyses of neonatal test performance (Norton et al., 2000). In this selected group there were 30 infants with bilateral impairment of at least mild degree, which is an incidence of 1%. There were approximately equal numbers of ears in the mild, moderate, severe and profound range of hearing loss. Risk factors associated with hearing loss were reviewed for the total sample of infants tested with VRA and for those infants with hearing loss. A history of treatment with aminoglycosides was the risk factor most often reported in the entire sample; however, there was no difference in prevalence of this risk factor for the normal-hearing and hearing-impaired groups. The risk factor associated with the highest incidence of hearing loss was stigmata of syndromes associated with sensorineural hearing loss and other neurosensory disorders. Sixty-seven infants who returned for follow-up could not be tested with VRA due to severe developmental delay or visual disability. Many of these infants had medical histories indicating the sequelae of extreme prematurity and/or very low birthweight.

CONCLUSIONS:Most of the hearing losses found in this study were mild and, based on clinical history and tympanometry tests, many of the mild and some of the moderate impairments may have been acquired in early infancy due to middle ear effusion. In the group of infants used for determination of neonatal test performance there were approximately equal numbers of mild, moderate, severe and profound losses. Only a small percentage of infants with a conventional risk indicator for hearing loss actually had a hearing loss, and there were a significant number of infants with hearing loss who did not have a risk indicator. These findings support the need for an early identification program based on universal neonatal hearing screening rather than by targeted testing of those with risk indicators.},

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that the gap over outer hair cells (OHCs) between the reticular lamina (RL) and the tectorial membrane (TM) varies cyclically during low-frequency sounds. Variation in the RL-TM gap produces radial fluid flow in the gap that can drive inner hair cell (IHC) stereocilia. Analysis of RL-TM gap changes reveals three IHC drives in addition to classic SHEAR. For upward basilar-membrane (BM) motion, IHC stereocilia are deflected in the excitatory direction by SHEAR and OHC-MOTILITY, but in the inhibitory direction by TM-PUSH and CILIA-SLANT. Upward BM motion causes OHC somatic contraction which tilts the RL, compresses the RL-TM gap over IHCs and expands the RL-TM gap over OHCs, thereby producing an outward (away from the IHCs) radial fluid flow which is the OHC-MOTILITY drive. For upward BM motion, the force that moves the TM upward also compresses the RL-TM gap over OHCs causing inward radial flow past IHCs which is the TM-PUSH drive. Motions that produce large tilting of OHC stereocilia squeeze the supra-OHC RL-TM gap and caused inward radial flow past IHCs which is the CILIA-SLANT drive. Combinations of these drives explain: (1) the reversal at high sound levels of auditory nerve (AN) initial peak (ANIP) responses to clicks, and medial olivocochlear (MOC) inhibition of ANIP responses below, but not above, the ANIP reversal, (2) dips and phase reversals in AN responses to tones in cats and chinchillas, (3) hypersensitivity and phase reversals in tuning-curve tails after OHC ablation, and (4) MOC inhibition of tail-frequency AN responses. The OHC-MOTILITY drive provides another mechanism, in addition to BM motion amplification, that uses active processes to enhance the output of the cochlea. The ability of these IHC drives to explain previously anomalous data provides strong, although indirect, evidence that these drives are significant and presents a new view of how the cochlea works at frequencies below 3~kHz.},

The headphone stimuli were digitally processed with the aim of duplicating, at a listener's eardrums, the waveforms that were produced by the free-field stimuli. The processing algorithms were based on each subject's free-field-to-eardrum transfer functions that had been measured at 144 free-field source locations. The headphone stimuli were localized by eight subjects in virtually the same positions as the corresponding free-field stimuli. However, with headphone stimuli, there were more front-back confusions, and source elevation seemed slightly less well defined. One subject's difficulty with elevation judgments, which was observed both with free-field and with headphone stimuli, was traced to distorted features of the free-field-to-eardrum transfer function.},

abstract = {Pitch is important for speech and music perception, and may also play a crucial role in our ability to segregate sounds that arrive from different sources. This article reviews some basic aspects of pitch coding in the normal auditory system and explores the implications for pitch perception in people with hearing impairments and cochlear implants. Data from normal-hearing listeners suggest that the low-frequency, low-numbered harmonics within complex tones are of prime importance in pitch perception and in the perceptual segregation of competing sounds. The poorer frequency selectivity experienced by many hearing-impaired listeners leads to less access to individual harmonics, and the coding schemes currently employed in cochlear implants provide little or no representation of individual harmonics. These deficits in the coding of harmonic sounds may underlie some of the difficulties experienced by people with hearing loss and cochlear implants, and may point to future areas where sound representation in auditory prostheses could be improved.},

abstract = {Acoustic stimuli are processed throughout the auditory projection pathway, including the neocortex, by neurons that are aggregated into 'tonotopic' maps according to their specific frequency tunings. Research on animals has shown that tonotopic representations are not statically fixed in the adult organism but can reorganize after damage to the cochlea or after training the intact subject to discriminate between auditory stimuli. Here we used functional magnetic source imaging (single dipole model) to measure cortical representations in highly skilled musicians. Dipole moments for piano tones, but not for pure tones of similar fundamental frequency (matched in loudness), were found to be enlarged by about 25% in musicians compared with control subjects who had never played an instrument. Enlargement was correlated with the age at which musicians began to practise and did not differ between musicians with absolute or relative pitch. These results, when interpreted with evidence for modified somatosensory representations of the fingering digits in skilled violinists, suggest that use-dependent functional reorganization extends across the sensory cortices to reflect the pattern of sensory input processed by the subject during development of musical skill.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to study the reliability of spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) suppression tuning curve (STC) measurements. Two repetitions of an SOAE STC, using a 4-dB suppression criterion, were obtained from 5 subjects who exhibited stable SOAE level (SD less than or equal to 1.5 dB) and SOAE frequency (+/- 5 Hz). Analyses of variance revealed no significant difference between the SOAE STC trials (p greater than .05). The SOAE frequency was below the SOAE STC tip, which is similar to the relationship between the probe frequency and a simultaneously masked psychophysical tuning curve. The mean slope of the SOAE STC low-frequency segment was 53.7 dB/octave, whereas the mean slope of the SOAE STC high-frequency segment was 124.8 dB/octave. The mean low- to high-frequency slope ratio was 2.4. The mean Q10 value for the 5 subjects was 5.3. The SOAE STC low- and high-frequency slopes and Q10 were similar to psychophysical tuning curve data obtained in simultaneous masking and physiological tuning curve data.},

abstract = {The etiology and mechanisms of specific language impairment (SLI) in children are unknown. Differences in basic auditory processing abilities have been suggested to underlie their language deficits. Studies suggest that the neuropathology, such as atypical patterns of cerebral lateralization and cortical cellular anomalies, implicated in such impairments likely occur early in life. Such anomalies may play a part in the rapid processing deficits seen in this disorder. However, prospective, longitudinal studies in infant populations that are critical to examining these hypotheses have not been done. In the study described, performance on brief, rapidly-presented, successive auditory processing and perceptual-cognitive tasks were assessed in two groups of infants: normal control infants with no family history of language disorders and infants from families with a positive family history for language impairment. Initial assessments were obtained when infants were 6-9 months of age (M=7.5 months) and the sample was then followed through age 36 months. At the first visit, infants' processing of rapid auditory cues as well as global processing speed and memory were assessed. Significant differences in mean thresholds were seen in infants born into families with a history of SLI as compared with controls. Examination of relations between infant processing abilities and emerging language through 24 months-of-age revealed that threshold for rapid auditory processing at 7.5 months was the single best predictor of language outcome. At age 3, rapid auditory processing threshold and being male, together predicted 39-41% of the variance in language outcome. Thus, early deficits in rapid auditory processing abilities both precede and predict subsequent language delays. These findings support an essential role for basic nonlinguistic, central auditory processes, particularly rapid spectrotemporal processing, in early language development. Further, these findings provide a temporal diagnostic window during which future language impairments may be addressed.},

abstract = {It is well-known that thresholds for ongoing interaural temporal disparities (ITDs) at high frequencies are larger than threshold ITDs obtained at low frequencies. These differences could reflect true differences in the binaural mechanisms that mediate performance. Alternatively, as suggested by Colburn and Esquissaud [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. Suppl. 1 59, S23 (1976)], they could reflect differences in the peripheral processing of the stimuli. In order to investigate this issue, threshold ITDs were measured using three types of stimuli: (1) low-frequency pure tones; (2) 100% sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) high-frequency tones, and (3) special, "transposed" high-frequency stimuli whose envelopes were designed to provide the high-frequency channels with information similar to that available in low-frequency channels. The data and their interpretation can be characterized by two general statements. First, threshold ITDs obtained with the transposed stimuli were generally smaller than those obtained with SAM tones and, at modulation frequencies of 128 and 64 Hz, were equal to or smaller than threshold ITDs obtained with their low-frequency pure-tone counterparts. Second, quantitative analyses revealed that the data could be well accounted for via a model based on normalized interaural correlations computed subsequent to known stages of peripheral auditory processing augmented by low-pass filtering of the envelopes within the high-frequency channels of each ear. The data and the results of the quantitative analyses appear to be consistent with the general ideas comprising Colburn and Esquissaud's hypothesis.},

What remains unknown is whether inner ear dysfunction can alter the brain to promote pathological behavior. Using molecular and behavioral assessments of mice that carry null or tissue-specific mutations of Slc12a2, we found that inner ear dysfunction causes motor hyperactivity by increasing in the nucleus accumbens the levels of phosphorylated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), key mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and plasticity. Hyperactivity was remedied by local administration of the pERK inhibitor SL327. These findings reveal that a sensory impairment, such as inner ear dysfunction, can induce specific molecular changes in the brain that cause maladaptive behaviors, such as hyperactivity, that have been traditionally considered exclusively of cerebral origin.},

abstract = {Acoustic intensity change, along with interaural, spectral, and reverberation information, is an important cue for the perception of auditory motion. Approaching sound sources produce increases in intensity, and receding sound sources produce corresponding decreases. Human listeners typically overestimate increasing compared to equivalent decreasing sound intensity and underestimate the time to contact of approaching sound sources. These characteristics could provide a selective advantage by increasing the margin of safety for response to looming objects. Here, we used dynamic intensity and functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural underpinnings of the perceptual priority for rising intensity. We found that, consistent with activation by horizontal and vertical auditory apparent motion paradigms, rising and falling intensity activated the right temporal plane more than constant intensity. Rising compared to falling intensity activated a distributed neural network subserving space recognition, auditory motion perception, and attention and comprising the superior temporal sulci and the middle temporal gyri, the right temporoparietal junction, the right motor and premotor cortices, the left cerebellar cortex, and a circumscribed region in the midbrain. This anisotropic processing of acoustic intensity change may reflect the salience of rising intensity produced by looming sources in natural environments.},

abstract = {Under some conditions, threshold for a brief tone is higher at the onset of a broadband masker than it is if it is delayed from the onset of the masker. Evidence suggests that this "overshoot" is related to active processing in the auditory system. The present experiments examined this question, by measuring frequency selectivity under the same conditions in which overshoot was measured. The first experiment demonstrated that the growth of masking with masker level was approximately linear for a 1-kHz signal with or without a precursor (which was identical to the masker), and a 4-kHz signal with a precursor. For the 4-kHz signal with no precursor, an elevation in signal-to-masker ratio was seen at mid masker levels, relative to the other conditions. Frequency selectivity was then measured for a fixed-level signal, with and without a precursor. Relative frequency selectivity was highest for the 4-kHz signal with no precursor, lower for the 1-kHz signal with no precursor, and lowest for the 1- or 4-kHz signal with a precursor. The overshoot results and the frequency selectivity results would be consistent with stronger active processing at 4 kHz than at 1 kHz, and a decrease in active processing following a broadband noise precursor.},

Near perfect recall of the final words of the three-word sets by both good- and poor-hearing participants allowed the inference that all three words had been correctly identified. Nevertheless, the poor-hearing group recalled significantly fewer of the nonfinal words than did the better hearing group. This was true even though both groups were matched for age, education, and verbal ability. Results were taken as support for an effortfulness hypothesis: the notion that the extra effort that a hearing-impaired listener must expend to achieve perceptual success comes at the cost of processing resources that might otherwise be available for encoding the speech content in memory.},

abstract = {Frequency selectivity in the inner ear is fundamental to hearing and is traditionally thought to be similar across mammals. Although direct measurements are not possible in humans, estimates of frequency tuning based on noninvasive recordings of sound evoked from the cochlea (otoacoustic emissions) have suggested substantially sharper tuning in humans but remain controversial. We report measurements of frequency tuning in macaque monkeys, Old-World primates phylogenetically closer to humans than the laboratory animals often taken as models of human hearing (e.g., cats, guinea pigs, chinchillas). We find that measurements of tuning obtained directly from individual auditory-nerve fibers and indirectly using otoacoustic emissions both indicate that at characteristic frequencies above about 500 Hz, peripheral frequency selectivity in macaques is significantly sharper than in these common laboratory animals, matching that inferred for humans above 4-5 kHz. Compared with the macaque, the human otoacoustic estimates thus appear neither prohibitively sharp nor exceptional. Our results validate the use of otoacoustic emissions for noninvasive measurement of cochlear tuning and corroborate the finding of sharp tuning in humans. The results have important implications for understanding the mechanical and neural coding of sound in the human cochlea, and thus for developing strategies to compensate for the degradation of tuning in the hearing-impaired.},

abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that cognitive functions, such as attention and memory, drive perception by tuning sensory mechanisms to relevant acoustic features. Long-term musical experience also modulates lower-level auditory function, although the mechanisms by which this occurs remain uncertain. In order to tease apart the mechanisms that drive perceptual enhancements in musicians, we posed the question: do well-developed cognitive abilities fine-tune auditory perception in a top-down fashion? We administered a standardized battery of perceptual and cognitive tests to adult musicians and non-musicians, including tasks either more or less susceptible to cognitive control (e.g., backward versus simultaneous masking) and more or less dependent on auditory or visual processing (e.g., auditory versus visual attention). Outcomes indicate lower perceptual thresholds in musicians specifically for auditory tasks that relate with cognitive abilities, such as backward masking and auditory attention. These enhancements were observed in the absence of group differences for the simultaneous masking and visual attention tasks. Our results suggest that long-term musical practice strengthens cognitive functions and that these functions benefit auditory skills. Musical training bolsters higher-level mechanisms that, when impaired, relate to language and literacy deficits. Thus, musical training may serve to lessen the impact of these deficits by strengthening the corticofugal system for hearing.},

The functional roles of the MOC efferents are not fully understood, especially in humans, despite postulations that they are involved in protection against acoustic trauma, facilitation of transient-sound perception, etc. Delineating the frequency tuning properties of the MOC efferents would provide critical evidence to support or refute these postulated functional roles. By utilizing spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs), a cochlear measure sensitive to MOC modulation, we systematically demonstrate in humans that the contralateral MOC reflex is tuned to a fixed frequency band between 500 and 1,000 Hz independent of SOAE frequency. Our results question the role of the MOC reflex in protection against acoustic trauma or facilitation of transient-sound perception.},

abstract = {Binaural interaction occurs in the auditory evoked potentials when the sum of the monaural auditory evoked potentials are not equivalent to the binaural evoked auditory potentials. Binaural interaction of the early- (0-10 ms), middle- (10-50 ms) and long-latency (50-200 ms) auditory evoked potentials was studied in 17 normal young adults. For the early components, binaural interaction was maximal at 7.35 ms accounting for a reduction of 21% of the amplitude of the binaural evoked potentials. For the middle latency auditory evoked potentials, binaural interaction was maximal at 39.6 ms accounting for a reduction of 48% of the binaural evoked potential. For the long-latency auditory evoked potentials, binaural interaction was maximal at 145 ms accounting for a reduction of 38% of the binaural evoked potential. In all of the auditory evoked potentials binaural interaction was long lasting around the maxima. The binaural interaction component extends for several milliseconds in the brainstem to tens of milliseconds in the middle- and long-latency components. Binaural interaction takes the form of a reduction of amplitude of the binaural evoked potential relative to the sum of the monaural responses, suggests that inhibitory processes are represented in binaural interaction using evoked potentials. Binaural processing in the auditory pathway is maximal in the time domain of the middle-latency components reflecting activity in the thalamo-cortical portions of the auditory pathways.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Identify the distribution of typical noise levels present in daily life and identify factors associated with average sound levels.

DESIGN:This was an observational study.

STUDY SAMPLE:Participants (N = 286) were 20 to 68 year old men and women, drawn from the general population of Kalamazoo County, Michigan. A total of 73 000 person-hours of noise monitoring were conducted.

RESULTS:Median overall daily average levels were 79 and 77 dBLeq(A,8,equiv), with average levels exceeding EPA recommended levels for 70% of participants. Median levels were similar between the hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and varied little across days of the week. Gender, occupational classification, and history of occupational noise exposure were related to average noise levels, but age, educational attainment, and non-occupational noise exposures were not.

CONCLUSIONS:A large portion of the general population is exposed to noise levels that could result in long-term adverse effects on hearing. Gender and occupation were most strongly related to exposure, though most participants in this study had occupations that are not conventionally considered noisy.},

abstract = {Musicianship confers enhancements to hearing at nearly all levels of the auditory system from periphery to percept. Musicians' superior psychophysical abilities are particularly evident in spectral discrimination and noise-degraded listening tasks, achieving higher perceptual sensitivity than their nonmusician peers. Greater spectral acuity implies that musicianship may increase auditory filter selectivity. This hypothesis was directly tested by measuring both forward- and simultaneous-masked psychophysical tuning curves. Sharper filter tuning (i.e., higher Q10) was observed in musicians compared to nonmusicians. Findings suggest musicians' pervasive listening benefits may be facilitated, in part, by superior spectral processing/decomposition as early as the auditory periphery.},

abstract = {Our different senses provide complementary evidence about the environment and their interaction often aids behavioral performance or alters the quality of the sensory percept. A traditional view defers the merging of sensory information to higher association cortices, and posits that a large part of the brain can be reduced into a collection of unisensory systems that can be studied in isolation. Recent studies, however, challenge this view and suggest that cross-modal interactions can already occur in areas hitherto regarded as unisensory. We review results from functional imaging and electrophysiology exemplifying cross-modal interactions that occur early during the evoked response, and at the earliest stages of sensory cortical processing. Although anatomical studies revealed several potential origins of these cross-modal influences, there is yet no clear relation between particular functional observations and specific anatomical connections. In addition, our view on sensory integration at the neuronal level is coined by many studies on subcortical model systems of sensory integration; yet, the patterns of cross-modal interaction in cortex deviate from these model systems in several ways. Consequently, future studies on cortical sensory integration need to leave the descriptive level and need to incorporate cross-modal influences into models of the organization of sensory processing. Only then will we be able to determine whether early cross-modal interactions truly merit the label sensory integration, and how they increase a sensory system's ability to scrutinize its environment and finally aid behavior.},

Despite many similarities both in the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion in these species, there are a number of differences which may have important physiologic implications. In the organ of Corti, the major differences among species are the length and width of the basilar membrane, the number of inner and outer hair cells, and the length of hairs on both inner and outer hair cells. Significant differences in the innervation pattern of the inner hair cell among these species include the number of afferent nerve terminals per inner hair cell, the degree of branching of afferent fibers, and the number of synapses per afferent nerve terminal. Among outer hair cells, the number of afferent nerve terminals per outer hair cell, presence or absence of a pre-synaptic body, presence or absence of reciprocal synapses, the number of efferent terminals per outer hair cell, and the presence of dendodendritic synapses in outer spiral bundles may be differences important physiologically. In the spiral ganglion, there are significant differences in the number of spiral ganglion cells, the number of cochlear nerve fibers, the percentage of spiral ganglion cells which are myelinated, and the presence of synapses on spiral ganglion cells.},

abstract = {Masked threshold for a pure-tone signal can be substantially elevated whenever the listener is uncertain about the spectral or temporal properties of the masker, an effect referred to as auditory informational masking. Individual differences in the effect are large, with young children being most susceptible. When masker uncertainty is introduced by randomizing the frequencies of a multitone masker on each presentation, the function relating a child's pure-tone signal threshold to the number of masker components is found to be substantially elevated above that of most adults. The age effect and the individual differences among adults are not well understood, though a difference in the shapes of the masking functions suggests that different detection strategies may be involved. The present study reports results from a principal components analysis of informational masking functions obtained from 38 normal-hearing children ranging in age from 4 to 16 years and 46 normal-hearing adults ranging in age from 19 to 38 years. The premise underlying the analysis is that if different detection strategies are involved, they should add independent sources of variance to the masking functions. Hence, more than one principal component (PC) should be required to account for a substantial proportion of the variance in these functions. The results, instead, supported the operation of a single underlying strategy with all but 17% of the variance accounted for by the first PC within and across age groups. An analysis of variance on the first two PCs showed that only the first changed with age, and a cluster analysis of the masking functions showed complete separation of clusters along this PC for all but 1 listener. The results are taken to suggest that large individual differences informational masking at all ages reflect differences in the extent to which masker uncertainty adds variance to the decision variable of an otherwise optimal decision strategy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: To measure spatial acuity on a right-left discrimination task in 2-to-3-year-old children who use a unilateral cochlear implant (UCI) or bilateral cochlear implants (BICIs); to test the hypothesis that BICI users perform significantly better when they use two CIs than when using a single CI, and that they perform better than the children in the UCI group; to determine how well children with CIs perform compared with children who have normal acoustic hearing (NH); to determine the effect of intensity roving on spatial acuity.

DESIGN:: Three groups of children between 26 and 36 months of age participated in this study: 8 children with NH (mean age: 30.9 months), 12 children who use a UCI (mean age: 31.9 months), and 27 children who use BICIs (mean age: 30.7 months). Testing was conducted in a large sound-treated booth with loudspeakers positioned in a horizontal arc with a radius of 1.2 m. The observer-based psychophysical procedure was used to measure the children's ability to identify the hemifield containing the sound source (right versus left). Two methods were used for quantifying spatial acuity, an adaptive-tracking method and a fixed-angle method. In Experiment 1 an adaptive tracking algorithm was used to vary source angle, and the minimum audible angle (MAA), the smallest angle at which right-left discrimination performance is better than chance, was estimated. All three groups participated in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2 source angles were fixed at {\textpm}50 degrees, and performance was evaluated by computing the number of SDs above chance. Children in the UCI and BICI groups participated in Experiment 2.

RESULTS:: In Experiment 1, when stimulus intensity was roved by 8 dB, MAA thresholds were 3.3 degrees to 30.2 degrees (mean = 14.5 degrees) and 5.7 degrees to 69.6 degrees (mean = 30.9 degrees) in the NH group and in the BICI group, respectively. When the intensity level was fixed for the BICI group, performance did not improve. Within the BICI group, 5 out of 27 children obtained MAA thresholds within one SD of their peers who have NH; all five had >12 months of bilateral listening experience. In Experiment 2, BICIs provided some advantages when the intensity level was fixed. First, the BICI group outperformed the UCI group. Second, children in the BICI group who repeated the task with their 1st CI alone had statistically significantly better performance when using both devices. In addition, when intensity roving was introduced, a larger percentage of children who had 12 or more months of BICI experience continued to perform above chance than children who had <12 months of BICI experience. Taken together, the results suggest that children with BICIs have spatial acuity that is better than when using their first CI alone and than that of their peers who use UCIs. In addition, longer durations of BICI use tend to result in better performance, although this cannot be generalized to all participants.

CONCLUSION:: This report is consistent with a growing body of evidence that spatial-hearing skills can emerge in young children who use BICIs. The observation that these skills are not concomitantly emerging in age- and experience-matched children who use UCIs suggests that BICIs provide cues that are necessary for these spatial-hearing skills that UCIs do not provide.},

abstract = {Efferent feedback shapes afferent auditory processing. Auditory attention has been shown to modulate medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent activity in human adults. Since auditory attention continues to develop throughout childhood, the present study explored whether attentional control of medial-efferent inhibition in 5-10 year-old children is adult-like. MOC inhibition was measured in adults (n = 14) and children (n = 12) during no-task (contralateral broadband noise), passive (contralateral noise with tone-pips) and active listening conditions (attended tone-pips embedded in contralateral broadband noise). A stronger MOC inhibition was observed when measured during the active listening condition for adults which is consistent with past work. However, the effect of auditory attention on MOC inhibition in children was not robust and was significantly lower compared to that observed for adults. These findings suggest the potential immaturity of the attentional mediation of MOC inhibition in tested children.},

abstract = {In this study, a nonlinear version of the stimulus-frequency OAE (SFOAE), called the nSFOAE, was used to measure cochlear responses from human subjects while they simultaneously performed behavioral tasks requiring, or not requiring, selective auditory attention. Appended to each stimulus presentation, and included in the calculation of each nSFOAE response, was a 30-ms silent period that was used to estimate the level of the inherent physiological noise in the ear canals of our subjects during each behavioral condition. Physiological-noise magnitudes were higher (noisier) for all subjects in the inattention task, and lower (quieter) in the selective auditory-attention tasks. These noise measures initially were made at the frequency of our nSFOAE probe tone (4.0~kHz), but the same attention effects also were observed across a wide range of frequencies. We attribute the observed differences in physiological-noise magnitudes between the inattention and attention conditions to different levels of efferent activation associated with the differing attentional demands of the behavioral tasks. One hypothesis is that when the attentional demand is relatively great, efferent activation is relatively high, and a decrease in the gain of the cochlear amplifier leads to lower-amplitude cochlear activity, and thus a smaller measure of noise from the ear.},

abstract = {The frequency selectivity of the auditory system was measured by masking a sinusoidal signal (0.5, 2.0, or 4.0 kHz) or a filtered-speech signal with a wideband noise having a notch, or stopband, centered on the signal. As the notch was widened performance improved for both types of signal but the rate of improvement decreased as the age of the 16 listeners increased from 23 to 75 years, indicating a loss in frequency selectivity with age. Auditory filter shapes derived from the tone-in-noise data show (a) that the passband of the filter broadens progressively with age, and (b) that the dynamic range of the filter ages like the audiogram. That is, the range changes little with age before 55, but beyond this point there is an accelerating rate of loss. The speech experiment shows comparable but smaller effects. The filter-width measurements show that the critical ratio is a poor estimator of frequency selectivity because it confounds the tuning of the system with the efficiency of the signal-detection and speech-processing mechanisms that follow the filter. An alternative, one-point measure of frequency selectivity, which is both sensitive and reliable, is developed via the filter-shape model of masking.},

Data on (a) imagery for auditory features (pitch, timbre, loudness), (b) imagery for complex nonverbal auditory stimuli (musical contour, melody, harmony, tempo, notational audiation, environmental sounds), (c) imagery for verbal stimuli (speech, text, in dreams, interior monologue), (d) auditory imagery's relationship to perception and memory (detection, encoding, recall, mnemonic properties, phonological loop), and (e) individual differences in auditory imagery (in vividness, musical ability and experience, synesthesia, musical hallucinosis, schizophrenia, amusia) are considered. It is concluded that auditory imagery (a) preserves many structural and temporal properties of auditory stimuli, (b) can facilitate auditory discrimination but interfere with auditory detection, (c) involves many of the same brain areas as auditory perception, (d) is often but not necessarily influenced by subvocalization, (e) involves semantically interpreted information and expectancies, (f) involves depictive components and descriptive components, (g) can function as a mnemonic but is distinct from rehearsal, and (h) is related to musical ability and experience (although the mechanisms of that relationship are not clear).},

abstract = {The performance of a group of twenty 6-year-old children with specific language impairment (SLI) on several behavioural auditory tests was compared to that of a group of twenty age-matched control children. The auditory test battery used in this study consisted of the following tests: a speech-in-noise test, a filtered speech test, a binaural fusion test, a frequency pattern test, a duration pattern test, a temporal integration test, an auditory word discrimination test, an auditory synthesis test, an auditory closure test and a number recall test. Our results show that the SLI children obtained scores on almost all tests that were significantly lower than those of the control group. Many of the basic auditory processing measures in our test battery correlated significantly with receptive and language scores, suggesting a (causal) relationship between auditory processing and language proficiency. Results from discriminant function analyses do not warrant deleting one or more tests from the test battery yet (with the exception of the auditory synthesis test and the temporal integration test, for which we did not find significant group effects). At present, we are conducting experiments with older (SLI and control) children and adults to find whether the significant performance deficits of the SLI children are also found in older SLI children, and to determine the influence of maturational effects on these auditory tests.},

abstract = {The presence of irrelevant auditory information (other talkers, environmental noises) presents a major challenge to listening to speech. The fundamental frequency (F(0)) of the target speaker is thought to provide an important cue for the extraction of the speaker's voice from background noise, but little is known about the relationship between speech-in-noise (SIN) perceptual ability and neural encoding of the F(0). Motivated by recent findings that music and language experience enhance brainstem representation of sound, we examined the hypothesis that brainstem encoding of the F(0) is diminished to a greater degree by background noise in people with poorer perceptual abilities in noise. To this end, we measured speech-evoked auditory brainstem responses to /da/ in quiet and two multitalker babble conditions (two-talker and six-talker) in native English-speaking young adults who ranged in their ability to perceive and recall SIN. Listeners who were poorer performers on a standardized SIN measure demonstrated greater susceptibility to the degradative effects of noise on the neural encoding of the F(0). Particularly diminished was their phase-locked activity to the fundamental frequency in the portion of the syllable known to be most vulnerable to perceptual disruption (i.e., the formant transition period). Our findings suggest that the subcortical representation of the F(0) in noise contributes to the perception of speech in noisy conditions.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:There is some controversy in the literature about whether auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) can be reliably recorded in all subjects and whether these responses consistently decrease in amplitude during drowsiness. In 10 subjects, 40-Hz ASSRs became significantly different from background electroencephalogram activity with a probability of P < 0.01 and an average time of 22 s (range, 2-92 s), provided that the responses were analyzed with time-domain averaging rather than spectral averaging. In a second experiment with 10 subjects, 40-Hz ASSRs recorded between the vertex and posterior neck consistently decreased in amplitude during drowsiness and sleep. Findings that the ASSR may occasionally increase during drowsiness may be explained by postauricular muscle responses recorded from a mastoid reference. These may occur during drowsiness in association with rolling-eye movements. ASSRs recorded between the vertex and posterior neck are not distorted by these reflexes. These findings combine with previous literature on the effects of general anesthetics on the ASSR to confirm that the ASSR is a valid option for monitoring the hypnotic effects of general anesthetics.

IMPLICATIONS:Auditory steady-state responses to stimuli presented at rates near 40 Hz can be used to monitor anesthesia. These responses can be quickly and reliably recorded during both sleep and wakefulness, provided that appropriate averaging techniques are used.},

AIM:Analyze the efferent auditory system activity by otoacoustic emission suppression and acoustic reflex sensitization in human subjects with auditory processing disorders.

METHOD:Prospective study: fifty children with auditory processing disorders (study group) and thirty-eight children without auditory processing disorders (control group) were evaluated using otoacoustic emission with and without contralateral noise; and acoustic reflex with and without contralateral facilitating stimuli.

RESULTS:OAE suppression mean value was equal to or less than 1.50 dB for the control group, and equal to or less than 1.26 dB for the study group. The mean sensitization reflex value was equal to or less than 14.60 dB for the study group and equal to or less than 15.21 dB for the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the responses from the control group and the study group in both procedures.

CONCLUSION:The study group had lower OAE suppression values and higher acoustic reflex sensitization values when compared to the control group.},

abstract = {This study investigated the binaural temporal window in adults and children 5-10.5 years of age. Detection thresholds were estimated for a brief, interaurally out-of-phase (Spi) 500 Hz pure tone signal masked by bandpass, 100-2000 Hz Gaussian noise. In one set of conditions, the masker was consistently either in phase (No) or out of phase (Npi). In another set of conditions, the masker changed abruptly in interaural phase (NoNpi or NpiNo), and threshold was estimated at a range of delays with respect to the phase transition. Masked thresholds were also obtained in further conditions where the masker interaural phase was steady and the signal was of long duration. Age effects obtained with dynamic maskers could be accounted for by positing that children have a binaural temporal window with a relatively prolonged leading edge or that the children position the binaural temporal window relatively late with respect to the signal. Modeling of the reduced masking-level difference shown by children for a brief Spi signal presented in a steady No or Npi masker was more consistent with late placement of a symmetrical binaural temporal window than a binaural temporal window having a relatively prolonged leading edge.},

abstract = {The presence of short-latency (SL), less compressive-growing components in bandpass-filtered transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) waveforms may implicate contributions from cochlear regions basal to the tonotopic place. Recent empirical work suggests a region of SL generation between ∼1/5 and 1/10-octave basal to the TEOAE frequency's tonotopic place. However, this estimate may be biased to regions closer to the tonotopic place as the TEOAE extraction technique precluded measurement of components with latencies shorter than ∼5 ms. Using a variant of the non-linear, double-evoked extraction paradigm that permitted extraction of components with latencies as early as 1 ms, the current study empirically estimated the spatial-extent of the cochlear region contributing to 2 kHz SL TEOAE components. TEOAEs were evoked during simultaneous presentation of a suppressor stimulus, in order to suppress contributions to the TEOAE from different places along the cochlear partition. Three or four different-latency components of similar frequency content (∼2 kHz) were identified for most subjects. Component latencies ranged from 1.4 to 9.6 ms; latency was predictive of the component's growth rate and the suppressor frequency to which the component's magnitude was most sensitive to change. As component latency decreased, growth became less compressive and suppressor-frequency sensitivity shifted to higher frequencies. The shortest-latency components were most sensitive to suppressors approximately 3/5-octave higher than their nominal frequency of 2 kHz. These results are consistent with a distributed region of generation extending to approximately 3/5-octave basal to the TEOAE frequency's tonotopic place. The empirical estimates of TEOAE generation are similar to model-based estimates where generation of the different-latency components occurs through linear reflection from impedance discontinuities distributed across the cochlear partition.},

abstract = {Multiple retrograde and anterograde tracers were used to characterize a pathway that extends from the inferior colliculus to both the left and right cochlear nuclei via a synaptic relay in the superior olivary complex. Different fluorescent tracers were injected into the left and right cochlear nuclei to identify cells in the superior olivary complex that project bilaterally. Double-labeled cells were present in almost all periolivary nuclei; the majority were located in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body and the anteroventral periolivary nucleus. Because these two nuclei are targets of descending projections from the inferior colliculus, triple-labeling experiments were performed to determine whether collicular axons contact the periolivary cells that project to the cochlear nuclei. The results demonstrate that descending axons from the inferior colliculus contact periolivary cells that project to the cochlear nuclei, including periolivary cells that project bilaterally. This pathway could provide an opportunity for higher levels of the auditory system to influence activity bilaterally in the cochlear nuclei and thus to modulate the initial processing of acoustic information by the brain.},

abstract = {Suppression of the 2f1-f2 distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) provides an effective paradigm for the study of functional cochlear maturation in humans. DPOAE iso-suppression tuning curves (STCs) represent some aspect of peripheral filtering, probably related to the boundaries of distortion generation. Studies conducted thus far suggest that the cochlear tuning assessed by this technique is adult-like in humans by term birth (Abdala et al., Hear. Res. 98 (1996) 38-53; Abdala and Sininger, Ear Hear. 17 (1996) 374-385). However, there have been no studies of cochlear tuning in premature human neonates. DPOAE STCs and suppression growth functions were measured from 14 normal-hearing adults, 33 term and 85 premature neonates to investigate the developmental time course of cochlear frequency resolution and non-linearity. Premature neonates showed non-adult-like DPOAE suppression at f2 of 1500 and 6000 Hz: (1) STCs were narrower in width (Q10) and steeper in slope on the low-frequency flank of the tuning curve; (2) suppressor tones lower in frequency than f2 produced atypically shallow growth of DPOAE suppression. The influence of immature conductive pathways cannot be entirely ruled out as a factor contributing to these results. However, findings may indicate that an immaturity exists in cochlear frequency resolution and non-linearity just prior to term birth. The bases of this immaturity are hypothesized to be outer hair cell in origin.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to investigate the neural basis of the comprehension of speech in unmodulated noise ("energetic" masking, dominated by effects at the auditory periphery), and when presented with another speaker ("informational" masking, dominated by more central effects). Each type of signal was presented at four different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) (+3, 0, -3, -6 dB for the speech-in-speech, +6, +3, 0, -3 dB for the speech-in-noise), with listeners instructed to listen for meaning to the target speaker. Consistent with behavioral studies, there was SNR-dependent activation associated with the comprehension of speech in noise, with no SNR-dependent activity for the comprehension of speech-in-speech (at low or negative SNRs). There was, in addition, activation in bilateral superior temporal gyri which was associated with the informational masking condition. The extent to which this activation of classical "speech" areas of the temporal lobes might delineate the neural basis of the informational masking is considered, as is the relationship of these findings to the interfering effects of unattended speech and sound on more explicit working memory tasks. This study is a novel demonstration of candidate neural systems involved in the perception of speech in noisy environments, and of the processing of multiple speakers in the dorso-lateral temporal lobes.},

abstract = {Children between the ages of 4 and 7 and adults were tested in free field on speech intelligibility using a four-alternative forced choice paradigm with spondees. Target speech was presented from front (0 degrees); speech or modulated speech-shaped-noise competitors were either in front or on the right (90 degrees). Speech reception thresholds were measured adaptively using a three-down/one-up algorithm. The primary difference between children and adults was seen in elevated thresholds in children in quiet and in all masked conditions. For both age groups, masking was greater with the speech-noise versus speech competitor and with two versus one competitor(s). Masking was also greater when the competitors were located in front compared with the right. The amount of masking did not differ across the two age groups. Spatial release from masking was similar in the two age groups, except for in the one-speech condition, when it was greater in children than adults. These findings suggest that, similar to adults, young children are able to utilize spatial and/or head shadow cues to segregate sounds in noisy environments. The potential utility of the measures used here for studying hearing-impaired children is also discussed.},

abstract = {Definitions of Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) suggest that it is associated with
localisation problems (ASHA Working Group on APD, 2005; BSA APD Interest Group,
2003); however, there appears to be little or no direct evidence for this link in the literature.
The main aim of this project was to investigate whether poor localisation is in fact observed
in participants with suspected APD (sAPD).
Two studies were conducted on sAPD groups (age range 8 - 21 years in the pilot study and
7 - 12 years in the main study), characterised by normal pure tone audiometry, poor
performance on the Children's Auditory Performance Scale questionnaire (CHAPS),
parental concerns with education underperformance and referral to an APD out-patient
clinic. Results were compared to matched control groups. In the pilot study N = 24 per
group and in the main study N = 32: a total of 112 participants took part in the complete
project.
The aim of the project related to three linked hypotheses:
{\~A}{\quotesinglbase}{\^A}{\textbullet} mean localisation performance of an sAPD group is significantly worse than that of
a control group
{\~A}{\quotesinglbase}{\^A}{\textbullet} localisation performance of some members of an sAPD group is below the normal
range, as indicated by a control group
{\~A}{\quotesinglbase}{\^A}{\textbullet} localisation performance ofmost or all members ofan sAPD group is below the
normal range, as indicated by a control group
The project involved preliminary work in several areas, including development of
participant selection/screening procedures and development of measurement equipment,
including a loudspeaker array and associated drive electronics. The localisation task
involved 'click' stimuli with forced choice between numbered loudspeaker positions.
Twenty-three loudspeakers were positioned at ear level to the participant, over a 1800 arc
with a separation angle of 8.2 0 between adjacent loudspeakers. The main study was conducted in a similar fashion to the pilot study but included a noise distracter of multitalker
babble, intended to provide a more challenging listening condition.
Results from the pilot study confirmed that the basic experimental protocol was appropriate
for measurement of localisation accuracy. The majority of the control group had r.m.s.
discrepancy 11 values less than one 'loudspeaker unit' (i.e., less than 8.2{\~A}{\quotesinglbase}{\^A}{\textdegree}) whereas the
majority of the sAPD group had 11 values greater than one unit. The difference in group
means for 11 was statistically significant; however, the means were not very different and
there was considerable overlap between the two groups.
In the main study the control group performed better than the sAPD group [F(l, 62) = 28.9,
p < 0.001], performance when listening in quiet was better than when listening in noise, and
there was no interaction between subject group and listening condition. As previously
observed in the pilot study, group means in the main study were all relatively similar and
there was considerable overlap between the data sets.
In relation to the hypotheses listed above, it may be concluded that the results from the pilot
study and the main study confirm the first two hypotheses but not the third hypothesis.
Although the data obtained in both studies indicate inferior localisation performance in the
sAPD gro{\textasciitilde}ps compared to the control groups, all participants perform tolerably well and
there is little evidence that the localisation performance of any member of the sAPD group
would appear anomalous in everyday situations. At the end of this project, the suspicion
remains that the association of localisation problems with APD has arisen largely by
inference from the established link between localisation and central auditory processing.
Hence it may be concluded that the accepted defmitiqns of APD (ASHA Working Group
on APD, 2005; BSA APD Interest Group, 2003) should not be used at face value because
their statements on localisation in APD are ambiguous or perhaps misleading.},

In this experiment, listeners were asked to identify the location of a pulsed-noise target in the presence of a randomly located continuous noise masker. Both the target and masker were low-pass filtered at one of eight cutoff frequencies ranging from 1 to 16 kHz, and the signal-to-noise ratio was varied from -12 to +12 dB. The results confirm the importance of high frequencies for the localization of isolated sounds, and show that high-frequency content remains critical in cases where the target sound is masked by a spatially separated masker. In fact, when two sources of the same level are randomly located in space, these results show that a decrease in stimulus bandwidth from 16 to 12 kHz might result in a 30% increase in overall localization error.},

The volumes are aimed at all individuals with interests in hearing research including advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and clinical investigators. The volumes are intended to introduce new investigators to important aspects of hearing science and to help established investigators to betterunderstandthefundamentaltheoriesanddatain?eldsofhearingthatthey may not normally follow closely. Each volume presents a particular topic comprehensively, and each servesas a synthetic overview and guide to the literature. As such, the chapters present neither exhaustive data reviews nor original research that has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed journals. The volumes focus on topics that have developed a solid data and conceptual foundation rather than on those for which a literature is only beginning to develop. New research areas will be covered on a timely basis in the series as they begin to mature. Eachvolumeintheseriesconsistsofafewsubstantialchaptersonaparticular topic. In some cases, the topics will be ones of traditional interest for which there is a substantial body of data and theory, such as auditory neuroanatomy (Vol. 1) and neurophysiology (Vol. 2).

abstract = {Efferent auditory pathways have been implicated in sound localization and its plasticity. We examined the role of the olivocochlear system (OC) in horizontal sound localization by the ferret and in localization learning following unilateral earplugging. Under anesthesia, adult ferrets underwent olivocochlear bundle section at the floor of the fourth ventricle, either at the midline or laterally (left). Lesioned and control animals were trained to localize 1 s and 40 ms amplitude-roved broadband noise stimuli from one of 12 loudspeakers. Neither type of lesion affected normal localization accuracy. All ferrets then received a left earplug and were tested and trained over 10 d. The plug profoundly disrupted localization. Ferrets in the control and lateral lesion groups improved significantly during subsequent training on the 1 s stimulus. No improvement (learning) occurred in the midline lesion group. Markedly poorer performance and failure to learn was observed with the 40 ms stimulus in all groups. Plug removal resulted in a rapid resumption of normal localization in all animals. Insertion of a subsequent plug in the right ear produced similar results to left earplugging. Learning in the lateral lesion group was independent of the side of the lesion relative to the earplug. Lesions in all reported cases were verified histologically. The results suggest the OC system is not needed for accurate localization, but that it is involved in relearning localization during unilateral conductive hearing loss.},

abstract = {Overexposure to intense sound can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Postexposure recovery of threshold sensitivity has been assumed to indicate reversal of damage to delicate mechano-sensory and neural structures of the inner ear and no persistent or delayed consequences for auditory function. Here, we show, using cochlear functional assays and confocal imaging of the inner ear in mouse, that acoustic overexposures causing moderate, but completely reversible, threshold elevation leave cochlear sensory cells intact, but cause acute loss of afferent nerve terminals and delayed degeneration of the cochlear nerve. Results suggest that noise-induced damage to the ear has progressive consequences that are considerably more widespread than are revealed by conventional threshold testing. This primary neurodegeneration should add to difficulties hearing in noisy environments, and could contribute to tinnitus, hyperacusis, and other perceptual anomalies commonly associated with inner ear damage.},

abstract = {The outer hair cells of the organ of Corti are the target of abundant efferent projections from the olivocochlear system. This peripheral efferent auditory subsystem is currently thought to be modulated by central activity via corticofugal descending auditory system, and to modulate active cochlear micromechanics. Although the function of this efferent subsystem remains unclear, physiological, psychophysical, and modeling data suggest that it may be involved in ear protection against noise damage and auditory perception, especially in the presence of background noise. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that its activity is modulated by auditory and visual attention. A commonly used approach to measure olivocochlear activity noninvasively in humans relies on the suppression of otoacoustic emissions by contralateral noise. Previous studies have found substantial interindividual variability in this effect, and statistical differences have been observed between professional musicians and non-musicians, with stronger bilateral suppression effects in the former. In this paper, we review these studies and discuss various possible interpretations for these findings, including experience-dependent neuroplasticity. We ask whether differences in olivocochlear function between musicians and non-musicians reflect differences in peripheral auditory function or in more central factors, such as top-down attentional modulation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Music: A window into the hearing brain".},

One experiment on free-field sound localization corroborated previous findings that the minimum audible angle changes substantially toward the end of the first half year after birth, and 3 experiments explored interaural time discrimination in that age range. The first of these 3 experiments used an adaptive psychophysical procedure, showing that infants responded appropriately in a sound lateralization task that provides a direct measure of interaural time discrimination. The other 2 experiments improved on the psychophysical procedure by taking into account the ceiling level on performance in the task. Infants aged 16, 20, and 28 weeks had thresholds in the range of 50 to 75 microsec, with no apparent age difference. These thresholds were much lower than would be predicted from studies of free-field sound localization, indicating that sensitivity to interaural time differences is not a limiting factor for the precision of sound localization in this age range.

The two monaural conditions differed as a function of unoccluded ear orientation to the primary signal (monaural-near and monaural-far). Ease of listening ratings and word recognition scores were significantly poorer during monaural listening and significantly affected by ear orientation to the speech signal. Attentional effort was not significantly affected by changing from binaural to monaural-near listening, but was significantly poorer in the monaural-far condition than in either of the other listening conditions. There was a significant correlation between ease of listening ratings and word recognition, but no correlation between attentional effort and either ease of listening or word recognition.},

abstract = {Experience exerts a profound influence on the brain and, therefore, on behavior. When the effect of experience on the brain is particularly strong during a limited period in development, this period is referred to as a sensitive period. Such periods allow experience to instruct neural circuits to process or represent information in a way that is adaptive for the individual. When experience provides information that is essential for normal development and alters performance permanently, such sensitive periods are referred to as critical periods. Although sensitive periods are reflected in behavior, they are actually a property of neural circuits. Mechanisms of plasticity at the circuit level are discussed that have been shown to operate during sensitive periods. A hypothesis is proposed that experience during a sensitive period modifies the architecture of a circuit in fundamental ways, causing certain patterns of connectivity to become highly stable and, therefore, energetically preferred. Plasticity that occurs beyond the end of a sensitive period, which is substantial in many circuits, alters connectivity patterns within the architectural constraints established during the sensitive period. Preferences in a circuit that result from experience during sensitive periods are illustrated graphically as changes in a ''stability landscape,'' a metaphor that represents the relative contributions of genetic and experiential influences in shaping the information processing capabilities of a neural circuit. By understanding sensitive periods at the circuit level, as well as understanding the relationship between circuit properties and behavior, we gain a deeper insight into the critical role that experience plays in shaping the development of the brain and behavior.},

ABEPs were recorded from four channels, three of them orthonormal to each other, in response to alternating polarity clicks, presented at a rate of 11/s with interaural time differences (ITD) of 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0 ms and an intensity of 65 dB nHL, or isochronic to both ears with interaural intensity differences (IIDs) of 5, 10 and 15 dB (65 dB nHL +/- 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 dB, respectively). All 3-CLTs included 6 planar segments (labeled BdI, BdII, BdIII, BeI, BeII and Bf). Amplitudes of 3-CLT BI components were not significantly affected by increasing ITDs and IIDs, but latencies of all components increased significantly. The most remarkable finding was a significant change in apex orientations of BeI and BeII of the BI 3-CLT across stimulus conditions. The changes in BeI and BeII apex orientations, across stimulus conditions, may reflect differences in the anatomical representation of activity evoked by differently lateralized sounds. We suggest that this may indicate spatio-topic organization in the human brainstem.},

Particularly at rostral levels, neural representations of the acoustic signal are shaped by convergent inputs and show some degree of plasticity, even in adults. The fidelity with which brain regions represent a stimulus dimension is heterogeneous, and this has demonstrable implications for the perceptual consequences of damage to those regions. So-called higher-level disorders (e.g., phonologic ones) have become increasingly understandable, largely through work in cognitive neuroscience, which has begun to describe the functional architecture of the processes mediating sound recognition and comprehension.},

All children had normal hearing at the time of testing. The main goal of the study was to determine whether there was an association between a reduced MLD in the OME children and an abnormal ABR (in terms of prolonged absolute or interwave intervals, or interaural differences in the ABR waveforms). The results indicated that the group of children having a history of OME had significantly reduced MLDs and had significantly prolonged waves III and V, and I-III and I-V interwave intervals. The correlations between MLD and delays in absolute wave or interwave intervals were not significant. However, some correlations between interaural asymmetries of the interwave intervals and the MLD were significant. The results suggest that the reduction in MLD found in children having a history of OME may be related to abnormal brainstem processing.},

There was significantly more activation and a larger area of activation, particularly in association cortex, in the left temporal lobe during counting of targets compared to the no-target conditions, with a similar trend in the right hemisphere.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:It is possible for auditory prostheses to provide amplification for frequencies above 6 kHz. However, most current hearing-aid fitting procedures do not give recommended gains for such high frequencies. This study was intended to provide information that could be useful in quantifying appropriate high-frequency gains, and in establishing the population of hearing-impaired people who might benefit from such amplification.

DESIGN:The study had two parts. In the first part, wide-bandwidth recordings of normal conversational speech were obtained from a sample of male and female talkers. The recordings were used to determine the mean spectral shape over a wide frequency range, and to determine the distribution of levels (the speech dynamic range) as a function of center frequency. In the second part, audiometric thresholds were measured for frequencies of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.5 kHz for both ears of 31 people selected to have mild or moderate cochlear hearing loss. The hearing loss was never greater than 70 dB for any frequency up to 4 kHz.

RESULTS:The mean spectrum level of the speech fell progressively with increasing center frequency above about 0.5 kHz. For speech with an overall level of 65 dB SPL, the mean 1/3-octave level was 49 and 37 dB SPL for center frequencies of 1 and 10 kHz, respectively. The dynamic range of the speech was similar for center frequencies of 1 and 10 kHz. The part of the dynamic range below the root-mean-square level was larger than reported in previous studies. The mean audiometric thresholds at high frequencies (10 and 12.5 kHz) were relatively high (69 and 77 dB HL, respectively), even though the mean thresholds for frequencies below 4 kHz were 41 dB HL or better.

CONCLUSIONS:To partially restore audibility for a hearing loss of 65 dB at 10 kHz would require an effective insertion gain of about 36 dB at 10 kHz. With this gain, audibility could be (partly) restored for 25 of the 62 ears assessed.},

abstract = {Fourteen twin pairs, aged 8 to 10 years, were tested 3 times over 12 months; they included 11 children with language impairment (LI), 11 control children matched on nonverbal ability and age, and 6 co-twins who did not meet criteria for LI or control status. Thresholds were estimated for detecting a brief backward-masked tone (BM), detection of frequency modulation (FM), and pitch discrimination using temporal cues (deltaf0). Both BM and FM thresholds improved with training, and by the 2nd test session, FM thresholds were in the adult range. There were marked individual differences on BM and deltaf0 and, for both tasks, performance correlated with Tallal's Auditory Repetition Task administered 2 years previously. However, no auditory measure gave significant differences between LI and control groups; performance was influenced more by nonverbal than language ability. Some children did have a stable pattern of poor performance on certain auditory tasks, but their good FM detection raised questions about whether processing of auditory temporal information is abnormal. We found no evidence that auditory deficits are a necessary or sufficient cause of language impairments.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

abstract = {The Competing Words Subtest is a commonly used dichotic listening test for assessing binaural integration in children suspected of having an auditory processing disorder. In 124 children, standard scores from the subtest suggested a binaural integration deficit in 23% of the children tested. Because standard scores are derived from the combined scores of both ears during the test, children with normal performance in one ear and weak performance in the other ear may be overlooked. For these children, a measure of interaural asymmetry may be a more sensitive indicator of a binaural integration deficit. When an age-appropriate criterion for interaural asymmetry from the Competing Words Subtest was used, the incidence of a binaural integration deficit increased to 51% of the children tested. Four typical patterns of dichotic listening performance were identified based on results from the two scoring techniques.},

abstract = {A nonspeech pattern identification task was used to study the role of spatial separation of sources on auditory masking in multisource listening environments. The six frequency patterns forming the signal set were comprised of sequences of eight 60-ms tone bursts. Bursts of masking sounds were played synchronously with the signals. The main variables in the study were (1) the difference in spatial separation in the horizontal plane between signals and maskers and (2) the nature of the masking produced by the maskers. Spatial separation of signal and masker ranged from 0-180 degrees. The maskers were of two types: (1) a sequence of eight 60-ms bursts of Gaussian noise intended to produce predominantly peripherally based "energetic masking" and (2) a sequence of eight 60-ms bursts of eight-tone complexes intended to produce primarily centrally based "informational masking." The results indicated that identification performance improved with increasing separation of signal and masker. The amount of improvement depended upon the type of masker and the center frequency of the signal patterns. Much larger improvements were found for spatial separation of the signal and informational masker than for the signal and energetic masker. This was particularly apparent when the acoustical advantage of the signal-to-noise ratio in the more favorable of the two ears (the ear nearest the signal) was taken into account. The results were interpreted as evidence for an important role of binaural hearing in reducing sound source or message uncertainty and may contribute toward solving the "cocktail party problem."},

abstract = {Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) level from normal hearing individuals can vary by as much as 30 dB with small frequency changes (a phenomenon known as DPOAE fine structure). This fine structure is hypothesized to stem from the interaction of components from two different regions of the cochlea (the nonlinear generator region and the reflection component from the DP region). An efficient procedure to separate these two components would improve the clinical and research utility of DPOAE by permitting separate evaluation of different cochlea regions. In this paper, two procedures for evaluating DPOAE fine structure are compared: DPOAE generated by fixed-frequency primaries versus continuously sweeping primaries. The sweep DPOAE data are analyzed with a least squares fit filter. Sweep rates of greater than 8 s per octave permit rapid evaluation of the cochlear fine structure. A higher sweep rate of 2 s per octave provided DPOAE without fine structure. Under these conditions, the longer latency reflection component falls outside the range of the filter. Consequently, DPOAE obtained with sweeping tones can be used either to get more rapid estimates of DPOAE fine structure or to obtain estimates of DPOAE from the generator region uncontaminated by energy from the reflection region.},

abstract = {This study investigated the development of auditory frequency and temporal resolution using simultaneous and backward masking of a tone by a noise. The participants were 6- to 10-year-old children and adults. On the measure of frequency resolution (the difference in the detection threshold for a tone presented either in a bandpass noise or in a spectrally notched noise), 6-year-old children performed as well as adults. However, for the backward masking task, 6-year-olds had, on average, 34 dB higher thresholds than adults. A negative exponential decay function fitted to the backward masking data for subjects of all ages indicated that adult-like temporal resolution may not be reached until about 11 years of age. These results show that, measured by masking, frequency resolution has reached adult-like performance by 6 years of age, whereas temporal resolution develops beyond 10 years of age. Six-year-old children were also assessed with tests of cognitive ability. Improvements in both frequency and temporal resolution were found with increasing IQ score.},

Two reflection-source OAEs [TEOAEs: transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions evoked by a 47 dB sound pressure level (SPL) chirp; and discrete-tone SFOAEs: stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions evoked by 40 dB SPL tones, and assessed with a 60 dB SPL suppressor] were compared in 27 normal-hearing adults. The MOCR elicitor was a 60 dB SPL contralateral broadband noise. An estimate of MOCR strength, MOCR%, was defined as the vector difference between OAEs measured with and without the elicitor, normalized by OAE magnitude (without elicitor). An MOCR was reliably detected in most ears. Within subjects, MOCR strength was correlated across frequency bands and across OAE type. The ratio of across-subject variability to within-subject variability ranged from 2 to 15, with wideband TEOAEs and averaged SFOAEs giving the highest ratios. MOCR strength in individual ears was reliably classified into low, normal, and high groups. SFOAEs using 1.5 to 2 kHz tones and TEOAEs in the 0.5 to 2.5 kHz band gave the best statistical results. TEOAEs had more clinical advantages. Both assays could be made faster for clinical applications, such as screening for individual susceptibility to acoustic trauma in a hearing-conservation program.},

abstract = {The complex input/output function of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions is evaluated at different stimulus levels. The experimental response functions were best fitted to the reflectivity functions predicted by theoretical one-dimensional transmission-line models in the perturbative limit. Along with the otoacoustic emission sources usually considered, linear reflection from roughness (place-fixed) and nonlinear distortion (wave-fixed), a wave-fixed scattering potential is also considered, associated with the breaking of the scale-invariance symmetry, as a new additional mechanism for otoacoustic emission generation. A good fit was obtained, across stimulus level and frequency, for roughness, and not for nonlinear distortion, nor for scale-invariance violation. The phase-gradient delay of the same transient evoked otoacoustic emissions was consistent with the latency measured using a wavelet time-frequency technique, at all stimulus levels and frequencies. The results suggest that cochlear reflectivity is dominated by a component with a rapidly rotating phase, at all stimulus levels, in apparent contradiction with the usual assumption that, at high stimulus levels, a significant contribution to the transient evoked otoacoustic response should come from nonlinear distortion. Possible interpretations of this phenomenology are critically reviewed and discussed, considering the theoretical uncertainties and the limitations of the experimental technique.},

Distinctions are made between active loss reduction and true amplification, and between different types of emission source. The dynamic control exercised by the cochlea over the level of mechanical activity is analysed. An adaptive mechanism, capable of oscillatory transient behaviour is found both acoustically and psychophysically in response to strong low frequency stimulation. A feedback model is presented and used to predict aspects of emission behaviour.},

abstract = {We develop an objective, noninvasive method for determining the frequency selectivity of cochlear tuning at low and moderate sound levels. Applicable in humans at frequencies of 1 kHz and above, the method is based on the measurement of stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions and, unlike previous noninvasive physiological methods, does not depend on the frequency selectivity of masking or suppression. The otoacoustic measurements indicate that at low sound levels human cochlear tuning is more than twice as sharp as implied by standard behavioral studies and has a different dependence on frequency. New behavioral measurements designed to minimize the influence of nonlinear effects such as suppression agree with the emission-based values. A comparison of cochlear tuning in cat, guinea pig, and human indicates that, contrary to common belief, tuning in the human cochlea is considerably sharper than that found in the other mammals. The sharper tuning may facilitate human speech communication.},

abstract = {It was previously reported that low-frequency biasing of cochlear structures can suppress and modulate the amplitudes of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) in humans [Bian, L. and Watts, K. L. (2008). "Effects of low-frequency biasing on spontaneous otoacoustic emissions: Amplitude modulation," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123, 887-898]. In addition to amplitude modulation, the bias tone produced an upward shift of the SOAE frequency and a frequency modulation. These frequency effects usually occurred prior to significant modifications of SOAE amplitudes and were dependent on the relative strength of the bias tone and a particular SOAE. The overall SOAE frequency shifts were usually less than 2%. A quasistatic modulation pattern showed that biasing in either positive or negative pressure direction increased SOAE frequency. The instantaneous SOAE frequency revealed a "W-shaped" modulation pattern within one biasing cycle. The SOAE frequency was maximal at the biasing extremes and minimized at the zero crossings of the bias tone. The temporal modulation of SOAE frequency occurred with a short delay. These static and dynamic effects indicate that modifications of the mechanical properties of the cochlear transducer could underlie the frequency shift and modulation. These biasing effects are consistent with the suppression and modulation of SOAE amplitude due to shifting of the cochlear transducer operating point.},

abstract = {Objective: To study whether a change in cochlear tuning, measured using OAEs, could be detected due to contralateral activation of the efferent system using broadband noise. Design: Cochlear tuning measures based on SFOAE phase gradients and SFOAE-2TS ܁Q܀ were used to test this hypothesis. SFOAE magnitude and phase gradient were measured using a pure-tone sweep from 1248 to 2496 Hz at 50 dB SPL. 2TS curves of SFOAE were recorded with a suppressor frequency swept from 1120 to 2080 Hz at 50 dB SPL. DPOAE f2-sweep phase gradient was also obtained to allow comparisons with the literature. All three assays were performed across with- and no-CAS conditions. Study sample: Twenty-two young, normal-hearing adults. Results: CAS did not produce a statistically significant change in the tuning metric in any of the OAE methods used, despite producing significant reductions in the OAE magnitude. Conclusion: It is unknown whether this insensitivity to CAS is due to an insensitivity of these three measures to cochlear mechanical tuning. The results suggest that any changes in tuning induced by CAS that may occur are small and difficult to detect using the OAE measurement paradigms used here.},

abstract = {A question that has emerged over recent years is whether audiovisual (AV) speech perception is a special case of multi-sensory perception. Electrophysiological (ERP) studies have found that auditory neural activity (N1 component of the ERP) induced by speech is suppressed and speeded up when a speech sound is accompanied by concordant lip movements. In Experiment 1, we show that this AV interaction is not speech-specific. Ecologically valid nonspeech AV events (actions performed by an actor such as handclapping) were associated with a similar speeding-up and suppression of auditory N1 amplitude as AV speech (syllables). Experiment 2 demonstrated that these AV interactions were not influenced by whether A and V were congruent or incongruent. In Experiment 3 we show that the AV interaction on N1 was absent when there was no anticipatory visual motion, indicating that the AV interaction only occurred when visual anticipatory motion preceded the sound. These results demonstrate that the visually induced speeding-up and suppression of auditory N1 amplitude reflect multisensory integrative mechanisms of AV events that crucially depend on whether vision predicts when the sound occurs.},

abstract = {Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) serve both as sensory receptors and biological motors. Their sensory function is poorly understood because their afferent innervation, the type-II spiral ganglion cell, has small unmyelinated axons and constitutes only 5% of the cochlear nerve. Reciprocal synapses between OHCs and their type-II terminals, consisting of paired afferent and efferent specialization, have been described in the primate cochlea. Here, we use serial and semi-serial-section transmission electron microscopy to quantify the nature and number of synaptic interactions in the OHC area of adult cats. Reciprocal synapses were found in all OHC rows and all cochlear frequency regions. They were more common among third-row OHCs and in the apical half of the cochlea, where 86% of synapses were reciprocal. The relative frequency of reciprocal synapses was unchanged following surgical transection of the olivocochlear bundle in one cat, confirming that reciprocal synapses were not formed by efferent fibers. In the normal ear, axo-dendritic synapses between olivocochlear terminals and type-II terminals and/or dendrites were as common as synapses between olivocochlear terminals and OHCs, especially in the first row, where, on average, almost 30 such synapses were seen in the region under a single OHC. The results suggest that a complex local neuronal circuitry in the OHC area, formed by the dendrites of type-II neurons and modulated by the olivocochlear system, may be a fundamental property of the mammalian cochlea, rather than a curiosity of the primate ear. This network may mediate local feedback control of, and bidirectional communication among, OHCs throughout the cochlear spiral.},
